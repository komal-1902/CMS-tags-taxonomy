Alokito Hridoy (meaning enlightened soul in Bengali) is an educational NGO based in Bangladesh that provides quality education for children. The root cause of discrepancies in the job market lies in the early years of education. Children are crammed into a factory model that fails to prepare them for jobs that are yet to exist. To break this vicious cycle with a human-centric approach, Alokito Hridoy wanted to be more aware of how, where and who they piloted their first intervention with. They selected the children of factory workers in Tangail, Mirzapur, as their sample population and started conducting research to understand them better through a number of focused group discussions, home visits and interviews. Despite being blue-collar workers, the factory workers dreamed of prestigious, white-collar jobs for their children. To advance their dreams, Alokito Hridoy launched a low cost charter school 50 kilometers away from Dhaka in Tangail, Mirzapur. They started gathering evidence in the school to gradually address the problems in the education system. They came up with one solution after another to provide education that is relevant for now and the future. Gradually, they came up with an education model rooted in empathy, critical thinking, and collaborative problem-solving. They are improving the quality of education by preparing children with social, moral, emotional and cognitive skills to be adaptive, proactive and innovative problem solvers. The learning style is inquiry based: learning by playing, problem solving and inquiring. The initiative started the school with 100 students in Tangail, Mirzapur, about 50 kilometers north of Dhaka. The first year they educated students up to grade 3, all children of industrial workers. They are now educating 200 children up to grade 7 - their goal is to grow with the students and add a new grade each year. The school has a nominal fee, which adds a sense of accountability to the community and parents. A portion of Home Junctions sales, a retail outlet for home goods, goes to support Alokito Hridoy School. Alokito Hridoy knew from the start that a building is not the heart of a school, but rather it is the teachers. Hence they hire local teachers since they are the most knowledgeable about the area and the context. Teachers have an impact on students when they connect with them and are interested to learn more about them. Alokito Hridoy invest heavily in teacher training to nurture and empower them as the empathetic, 21st century facilitators and the catalyst of change in the school and community. The teacher training approaches have expanded beyond the walls of Alokito Hridoy. They have partnered with the government, non-government and private schools to work on teacher development in primary and secondary education. Their training modules are designed for Bangla, English, Madrasah medium schools across the country and has the potential to bridge these silos with the hope of ensuring access to quality education for all."

Access to water is a challenge in rural areas, due to access to energy to supply water from the sources. Such pumping device has been used for nearly a century in rural indigenous community for lifting water to certain height, which is useful application for water pumping and supply to a community. This pump is powered by wind.

Constraint: From the pump, a particular hydram works under a particular range of drive flow and of drive height. If the drive height or drive flow is too low, the water has not enough energy to create a water hammer effect. If the drive height or the drive flow is too high, the energy of the water causes too much stress on the pump and reduces its life time.

The company makes fuel pellets from biodegradable waste (e.g., spent coffee grounds, coffee husks, sawdust, wood chips, khat stems). Using pellets as a fuel source in gasifier cookstoves is superior to any other solid biomass because pellets are uniform in size, have low moisture content, have a high energy density, and are easier to transport and store. When these pellets are burned in fan-forced gasifier stoves, they turn into biochar (i.e., charcoal).

There are lots of villages in the world that are still not electrified or are receiving power erratically. Given the limited global supply of fossil fuels, the search for renewable energy has been on the top of the sustainability agenda. Biomass gasification, a century-old technology, is viewed today as an alternative to conventional fuel. In the gasification process, wood, charcoal, and other biomass materials are gasified to produce so-called producer gas for power or electricity generation. Mr. Rai Singh Dahiya observed that the users of biomass gas (producer gas) as a fuel generally complain about choking in the engine after running for a certain period. He solved this problem. The innovator has changed the conventional design of gasifiers, especially the filters and cooling units to get clean gas and ensure smooth operation of the engine at low operational cost. It is a downdraft type bio- mass gasifier, a compact and efficient system for converting BioMass into producer gas which is used as a fuel in running Diesel Engine by making little modification to the engine. The Biomass is burnt in a furnace packed from all the sides and has one outlet to pass the gases to another chamber where these gases are cooled and then passed through the filter for filtration. This filtered gas is then fed to the engine, as a substitute for diesel or like other fuel, for its running. 1. Compact, mobile, and a soundproof unit 2. Extremely clean gas generated from the gasifier, making downstream cleaning systems simple. 3. It converts the agricultural waste into the generation of the electrical power 4. No need for continuous flow of water, easy to operate, no extra training or skill is required 5. Reliable & rugged system, stand-alone mobile system, can be used anywhere where we need power. 6. All types of wood waste and fuelwood Stalks of cotton, pulses, coconut shells, coconut palm stalks, Maize cobs, Rice husk, Branches & twinges, briquettes of various agricultural residues, Certain Industrial wastes of paper mills, plywood industry, etc can be used as a fuel. 7. The fuel consumption is reported to be 1 kg/kVA, claimed to be almost 30-35 percent lesser than conventional gasifiers, and depending upon the feedstock it produces ash and charcoal (7-10%) as a by-product.

Mr. Mansukhbhai Prajapati
Morbi, Gujarat
Innovator Mr. Mansukhbhai Prajapati hails from Morbi district of Gujarat. His family left Morbi after the breakdown of Machchu Dam in 1979 and shifted to Vankaner. After completing his SSC, he worked for three years in a roof tiles manufacturing unit in Vankaner. After that, he joined his fathers business of manufacturing pottery in 1998. Mr. Mansukhbhai Prajapati has developed a small size natural refrigerator from clay material to store the perishable foods like vegetables, fruits, milk, etc and also for cooling water. It does not require any external source of energy for giving a cooling effect. He introduces the natural refrigerator as a ""Mitti Cool"" as totally made up from clay. It has two large water tanks at the top and bottom that cool the sides in the same manner as clay pots, keep water cool in summer. The upper portion of the refrigerator can store about 20 L water, while the bottom cabinet has separate space for storing fruits, vegetables and milk. The natural cooling process inside the refrigerator can keep vegetables and fruits fresh for around 6-7 days, while milk can be preserved for 3 days. A small plastic door having a magnetic lock is also provided to cover it from the front side. The overall dimension of the unit is 16.5 (length) X 13.5 (width) X 26.5 (height) inch and the total weight is 50 kg. The whole unit is painted in red colour for a better look. The internal storage capacity is around 50 L. Christened mud is prepared by mixing different types of materials like clay, grok, talcum powder, silicate and soda ash; and poured into the mould made of Plaster of Paris and exposed to sunlight. When it becomes dry mould is removed and the body is kept in a furnace at 700 °C for baking. The baked body is painted with red colour. For manufacturing one unit 7 days are required. Through the bottom layer of the upper chamber, small droplets of water continuously percolate below the bottom of first shelves which keep inner climate moist/wet permanently. Water evaporates through side walls also provides a cooling effect and reduces the inside temperature and thereby provides a cooling effect inside the unit. Apart from saving electricity bill, the new device also preserves the original taste of fruits and vegetables. It gives higher cooling in a dry climate compared to a humid climate. It takes about 12 h to get a cooling effect when using the first time. About 20 L of water, 5 kg of vegetables/fruits and 5 L of milk can be kept inside the refrigerator. It can lower the temperature by about 8 °C in comparison to the room temperature. It has been validated at KVK, Chas wad, Bharuch and found effectively working. The temperature in Mitti Cool is 4-5 °C lower than room temperature. The shelf life of coriander was found increased up to 4 days against 1.5-2 days at room temperature. The shelf life of brinjal, chilly & okra is 3-4 days in room temperature, which was found to be increased up to 6-7, 4-5 and 5-6 days respectively.

Mr. Khandira Baruah
Jorhat, Assam
Profile Innovator Mr. Khandira Baruah is from the Sonitpur district of Assam. He is inclined to innovative ideas and technologies from childhood. He also loves to write poems. Purpose In rural areas, firewood is being used as a primary source of fuel for cooking. However, due to ignorance and also by culture, a huge amount of heat energy gets wasted during cooking. Mr. Baruah came up with a new design of stove for the sustainable utilization of heat energy produced from firewood and other bio-resources for heat. Technical details This is a two-chambered innovative stove separated by a metallic circular plate from one chamber to the other. The upper chamber is meant for putting fuel resources in it. A dome-shaped metallic burner with an opening on the top is being placed on the upper fuel chamber which checks the airflow from the outer surroundings. Then the stove is placed above the burner. Above the whole arrangement, a circular metallic plate is being placed which protects the heat release from the firewood. After the complete set of the tool, the left out or waste biomaterial resources are kept into the upper chamber. With the help of a candle or match stick, the fire is set on the resources. Once the fire sets, other bioresources such as cow dung, unused wood materials, etc. are added into the existing burning fuel. The temperature of the heat can be regulated with the help of a regulator placed just beneath the upper chamber. The regulator is a flat circular plate having holes in it. The lower chamber is meant for collecting ashes released from the burnt biomaterial. The size and shape of the burners vary and can be used according to the need. Benefits It has a regulator that controls the temperature. All types of conventional fuel sources can be used in this stove. The fuel consumption of this stove is also very less.

Pune, Maharashtra
Profile Innovators Mr. R. M. Salunkhe and Dr. K. Dutta are from Pune district of Maharashtra. They are working with an NGO working for rural development through the implementation of innovative technologies in the field of non-conventional energy sources and agriculture. Purpose Mr. Salunkhe and Dr. Dutta have developed an innovative stove for fuel-saving, time-saving, and to improve the indoor air quality of the rural kitchen. Technical details The 'Sarai Stove' consists of four parts. All parts are made of mild steel. Combustion chamber: It is an open-ended cylinder, with an aluminum lining from inside. There is a door on the inside, and a series of holes along the periphery at the bottom. The holes serve as air inlets. There are two clamps on the side near the top for holding the outer jacket. Fuel holder This is a mild steel cylinder with an open top and a cast iron grate at the bottom. Solid fuel in the form of wood chips, coal, charcoal, biomass briquettes, etc. are placed in the holder, which in turn is placed inside the combustion chamber through its side door. Outer jacket It is an open-ended cylinder that fits on the top of the combustion chamber. There are two rows of holes circumscribing the cylinder near the top. Cooker with lid The cooker is a cylindrical vessel that can be inserted into the outer jacket, leaving an annular space of just about 2.5-3 mm between the walls of the two. It has a wide rim at the top, which seals up the annular space. The lid fits snugly into the open top of the cooker. To operate the stove, the fuel holder loaded with fuel is inserted into the combustion chamber. The outer jacket is fitted on to the chamber, and the cooker is inserted into it. About 200 ml of water is poured into the cooker and the cooking vessels are stacked in it, one on top of the other. The lid is closed and the fire is started. The air required for combustion of the fuel enters from the holes at the bottom of the combustion chamber and is sucked into the fuel stack through the grate at the bottom of the fuel holder. The hot gases and flames emitted by the fire pass through the annular space between the outer jacket and the cooker, and come out through the holes near the top of the outer jacket. The heat is conducted into the cooker through its bottom and walls and converts the water inside into the steam. The cooker fills up with steam and generates a sufficiently high temperature within the cooker to cook the food. Because of the fuel placed in the burner is limited, the stove extinguishes itself after a certain time. The food inside the vessel remains hot after the fire goes out due to the double jacket surrounding it. For frying or bread making, the outer jacket can be detached from the combustion chamber and the chamber can be used as a portable single pot stove. Performance The stove can be operated on any solid biomass fuel. Only 100 g of the charcoal is required to prepare food for 4-5 persons. The stove design is optimized for good combustion efficiency hence, cooking takes place in a smokeless environment. The outer jacket also can be used with a gas or kerosene stove, to increase fuel efficiency. Benefits The stove has higher fuel efficiency and it is smokeless. It increases the indoor air quality of the rural kitchen. Suggested Reading(s): YouTube, (2011). Sarai cooking stove, ARTI.

Collaborative project: Citizens participate in data collection and analysis.
Overall goal: Enhance social stakeholders’ knowledge in southwestern Buenos Aires, Argentina, with respect to the risk of heavy rains, overflows, and floods, and encourage their participation in flood risk management processes. Specific goals: Determine the population's perception and knowledge of flood and waterlogging hazards. Produce data and information and promote actions for flood risk management together with citizens and with the collaboration of different stakeholders. Raise flood hazard awareness by stressing the importance of knowledge and information regarding risks and their management. Encourage debate and reflection based on the perceptions and experiences of local stakeholders on flooding events. Add new features to InundApp which will enhance its use for flood risk management purposes. Promote InundApp as a technological tool that integrates the culture of prevention in the population' s everyday life. Foster cooperation among participating organizations by defining coordination mechanisms in the event of actual or potential flooding events.
Description of citizen participation Citizens participate mainly in: 1) Defining scenarios and building knowledge related to flood and waterlogging risks in the area, through two types of interactive participatory workshops: institutional (including specific activities aimed at some of the stakeholders in relation to their risk management role) and inter-institutional (aimed at members of all participating organizations with different risk management roles, which favors experience sharing). Activities are planned in two phases, in agreement with disaster risk management. The first stage involves knowledge and awareness of flood issues. The second stage consists of implementing techniques with a Participatory Action Research approach. 2) Producing data and phenomenon monitoring using a free mobile phone application (InundApp) easily installed and used. Thus, citizens can quickly report hydrometeorological events and affected elements in their immediate surroundings (collaborative mapping), by uploading text and capturing photographs. The application can be used to indicate which phenomenon is occurring and its effects.

How to use more natural light and less artificial light in interior spaces? This question was the trigger that planted an idea in three young people, a 17-year-old student and two 18-year-old boys. As a solution to the problem of electricity consumption, a prototype was developed that ""captures"" sunlight and transmits it to an interior space, prioritizing natural and ecological-sustainable energy. The prototype is an interior lighting system that captures and transports sunlight to closed and dimly lit environments. It does not consume electricity, which makes it friendly to the environment and represents a reduction in energy costs. The system consists of three stages. A solar tracker measures the angle of incidence of light on the platform. With this signal, it controls two engines that manage to direct the base in both axes until it is perpendicular to the incidence of the sun. This system manages to track the sun throughout the day just like sunflower plants do. Then a lens on the oriented platform focuses the solar radiation at a point where the entrance of an optical fiber (Core) is located. This circuit can be replicated as many times as necessary depending on the lighting required. Finally, the light concentrated thanks to the collector is transmitted through the fiber towards the environment to be illuminated. At the fiber optic outlet, a diffuser is placed, responsible for distributing the light evenly.

Access to good quality, safe water is essential to the health and well-being of communities around the world. However, water quality can vary considerably, and effective tools for real-time monitoring are crucial. In response to this need, an innovative system has been developed that uses sensor technology, WiFi connectivity and cloud services to assess and visualize water quality and provide timely alerts to users.
This is a program for a water quality detector using a home sensor. The program measures water conductivity, calculates the TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) value, and sends the data to ThingSpeak for real-time viewing and monitoring. In addition, it uses the Twilio service to send text messages with the water quality classification according to the ranges established by the World Health Organization (WHO).

Illac Diaz, Liter of Light, Lucas Herrero, Universidad de Palermo
In many towns in Argentina, power lines become unfeasible. This brings social and development problems in the communities. The lack of access to quality public lighting generates insecurity, not only from the criminal point of view, but also from the daily routine. One of the things that is often said about the lack of lighting, both in homes and abroad, is that it ""shortens the day"", relegating daily tasks only to moments of sunlight. We also see poor lighting in houses as a major problem, which generates lack of hygiene and self-development. Liter of Light Argentina makes quick-install public luminaires not only for specific interventions in neighborhoods, but also to provide lighting in cases of emergencies in which the neighborhood is left without electricity. The solution is based on the installation of luminaires that work with photovoltaic energy with a current of 12v, which are made with cheap and accessible materials throughout the world. These luminaires can be for inside houses, or units of 3 meters high to illuminate an area of ​​up to 40 square meters. The power supply of the system will use lead acid batteries (whose value ranges from US$20 to 50, which will last between 2 and 3 years). It comes with a 30 watt solar panel and can withstand strong winds and 12v outdoor lighting. All these elements can be obtained anywhere in the world, hence the versatility of this system. In turn, these systems, by providing 12v power, can be used to power cell phones, UHF and VHF radios, and other electronics. Thus generating the possibility of communication in case of supply cuts or consequences of natural phenomena. This means that the people of the communities not only learn about the power generation systems, the electrical risk (since these systems replace the clandestine electrical connections that generate fires), and the electrical infrastructure, but also generate in them more strength in knowledge, and communication capacity in case of health emergency. At the same time, they carry out health, hygiene and sanitation programs since some communities are also far from the health points. These programs help improve the quality of life of people with healthy habits and community nursing actions. T Therefore, this solution gives energy, light, security, adaptation, and technical and health knowledge to the populations. In other words, it not only gives them light, energy, and primary health care, but it leaves them the knowledge, and some infrastructure and equipment so that they can continue to work cooperatively. 
Prototype system
Liter of Light has installed more than 350,000 bottle lights in more than 15 countries and taught green skills to empower grassroots entrepreneurs at every stop. Liter of Light's open source technology has been recognized by the UN and adopted for use in some UNHCR camps. Liter of Light is the proud recipient of the 2016 St. Andrews Prize for the Environment, the 2015 Zayed Future Energy Prize, and a winner of the 2014-2015 World Habitat Award.
The lithium phosphate battery gives 12-16 hours of light everyday. It automatically lights up at nightfall and comes with an on/off switch. It has different lighting solutions: solar lamp, house light, street light and bottle light.

Public transportation plays a fundamental role in a city's mobility. Ensuring the efficiency, safety and punctuality of transportation systems is essential to improve the quality of life of citizens. In this sense, we propose the implementation of a transport route control and monitoring system based on IoT technologies and databases, with the objective of optimizing vehicle management and operation, and providing valuable information to both operators and users.
This project was carried out to help users to be able to use public transportation in a more optimal way as well as to help drivers to check the time they arrive at certain points so that the user can verify that their transportation is about to arrive or know if they can take the same or another one, besides it was seen as a problem because then one walks without knowing for sure how long it will take, as in some places it takes 20 min. to pass. A central database will be established that will store relevant information such as vehicle license plates, locations, estimated times and arrival records. This database will act as the main data store for the system."

The concept of electric solar mobility arises after observing the need for short but difficult transfers in the puna and the scarcity and high cost of fuel. In parallel, the region has a high level of solar radiation every day. The project proposes to introduce adapted bicycles with an electric engine and a battery that is recharged through photovoltaic panels located in ""Solar Service Stations"", which provide a range of about 30 km.
Prototype system
More than 500 people, including decision makers, experienced an electric bike ride. All of them were allowed to give a feedback about their experiences. 
People who work in the field and teachers would shorten travel times and avoid the use of fossil fuel. This has both immediate and long-term benefits. This project could be a starting point to achieve a paradigm shift in the Andean region. It would be part of the public debates on innovative clean and renewable energy mobility equipment, not fossil, to be used in urban and rural areas.

The Ñacuñán Reserve belongs to the World Program “Man and the Biosphere”, whose main goal is to improve the relationships between human beings and nature. From research projects of the CONICET Mendoza Scientific and Technological Center, contributions were proposed in this regard, which include an experience of solar cookers with the community that lives in the Reserve. This experience of transferring solar cookers made it possible to reduce the community's dependence on firewood, which arises in the absence of electricity and gas. The technology transfer process with the residents of Ñacuñán was conducted through awareness talks on the advantages associated with the use of Renewable Energy, and workshops on the production of solar cookers. In the workshops, the researchers provided the materials for making the equipment that was assembled together with the neighbors to achieve a better understanding of its operation.
Prototype System
Solar cooking in shelter schools and community centers in isolated areas requires heating large volumes of food, usually in pots of between 20 and 40 liters. In addition, several types of absorbers are optimized to fulfill different functions in a concentrator with an area of 2 m2. These alternatives make it possible to efficiently meet the needs of a communal kitchen and serve up to 30 children for each hub installed. 
Although in many cases the technology and knowledge transfer are successful, there is no real adoption as it is only used for a brief period. Therefore, project monitoring and budget allocation become extremely important to ensure the maintenance and monitoring of the technology.

Kaseb Al Shakhanbeh is testing the use of leftover food from local shops (like a cake shop) to make cheap feed for fish and livestock in his farm (which includes a fish farm). He saw this idea being tested in the West Bank, Palestine and decided to try it himself. What he is learning: - This is saving him money in the operations of his own farm. - The livestock feed has shown to increase the percentage of protein in the animals to 40% (before it was 15%). This means he can sell the livestock for a higher price. He is now testing this same approach for fish feed to see if it yields the same results. - He is also trying tell the feed to other farmers in winter because at that time of year there is no fresh grass so there is demand for the feed. He's selling a bag (not sure about weight) for 6 Jordanian Dinars per, which he says is good because it costs him zero JD to make the feed. Process of making the livestock feed: He takes leftover food from local shops for free Dries the food. Some foods need fermentation to get rid of toxinsC Crushes and mixes the different foods Adds corn to it Leaves it for 12 hours -3 days Process of testing the fish feed: Take leftover food and dry it Type of food: meat from chicken, bones, protein sources, melt , crushed, Shapes it into circles Challenges he faced: Needs hangar or caravan that is shielded from the sun and sanitized, which he can't afford. Currently using a tent which is not as hygienic. No tools to do it -having tools would make process faster. Using current method, 25 kilo per day, 3 people, 8 hours With tools, you could make 4 times the amount Not enough storage area.

The photovoltaic (PV) cells of the solar panels absorb sunlight and convert the energy from the sun into direct current (DC) electricity to charge the batteries. This DC electricity is fed to the batteries via a solar charge controller which ensures the batteries are charged most efficiently and not damaged. The charge controller constantly controls and manages the energy flow in the solar electric system. It regulates the state of charge of the batteries and the intensity of the charge. It protects the batteries from overcharge and deep discharge. DC appliances like 12 V LED-lights, cellphone or radio are powered directly from the charge controller which during daylight takes the energy directly from the PV panels and at night from the stored energy in the batteries. The inverter converts lower voltage DC electricity (12V) generated by the solar panels and stored in the batteries into higher voltage alternating current (AC) to power appliances that run with 120 V like electrical power tools, computer, television, etc. The big solar system has an additional device called battery protect that protects the battery from deep discharge, ensuring the longevity of the batteries. It works as a switch that turns off all the loads. The battery protect also communicates with the battery monitor and performs the function according to the information of the battery monitor. The battery monitor works together with a measurement device called Shunt that collects and transmits all the data about the system and sends it to the battery monitor.""

The Main Challenge:
The entrepreneurial ecosystem in Iraq is new and is still taking its first steps toward development. With many actors working to create an environment in which the private sector and entrepreneurship can foster, international attention has been drawn to reinforce ongoing efforts seeking to create this enabling environment to support the growth of the private sector and the economic development in Iraq. Several advancements have been made and the foundations of the ecosystem have been set, however, the need still arises for a place in which these efforts exist in one place and that’s where Startups bus comes into play. The StartupsBus Platform is tackling the below three main challenges within the entrepreneurial ecosystem, mainly in the newly liberated areas in Iraq: 1- There is lack of coordination& marketing of eco-system enablers' activities & programs. 2- There is lack of data about the entrepreneurial ecosystem in Iraq, and Mosul specifically. Also, there is no use of data generated from entrepreneurs to design new activities & programs based on their needs that are not visible to the stakeholders. 3- It's not easy for the entrepreneurs and SMEs to find local service providers that satisfy their business needs and finding channels to market their services.
The Solution, StartupsBus Platform:

Plastic Pollution Challenge: At the macro level, there is no mechanism for different action groups to collaborate and take ownership of environmental initiatives, especially on plastic. At the micro level, while there have been vigorous efforts to reduce plastic pollution and clean up the environment, most are scattered, disjointed and non-continuous quick fixes.
Solution GreenPoints: is a mobile application leveraging the power of gamification to make living green easier and more enjoyable. Collaborating with multiple stakeholders, GreenPoints encourages communities to take green actions under a wide range of themes (trash classification, clean up activities, etc), receive GP (the currency of the green ecosystem), and redeem points for gifts for self, family or community.
Innovation: We aim at becoming a platform to unite and amplify all stakeholders’ initiatives and interests. We apply gamification and game-based philosophy to making green actions more fun and engaging. Users can become green billionaires, and we can all celebrate their achievements together. GreenPoints provides tools for and incentivizes people to use less plastic, recycle more, take green actions, and reward themselves as well as their communities. That way, we touch both intrinsic and extrinsic motivations, self and social interests alike, and most importantly, leverage the resources of stakeholders and players to create a tool to tackle existing garbage and prevent future pollution.
Impact Model: A healthy environment: via green actions and gamification, and different themes of living green: clean up, education, reduction, reuse and recycling activities can be taken ; Better social well-being: individual, group-based, and family themes create a better sense of belonging and self-actualization; Better coordination: dashboards and ranking in the GreenPoints app, motivate stakeholders to act more transparently to promote themselves as accountable actors in the ecosystem; Better economic security: the Green Point virtual currency incentivizes actions for rewards – make refillable products and grow vegetables, make organic compost; green donation to match money funded from sponsors."

Edama Organic Solutions are the leading entity in creating a local circular economy that recycles organic waste into high-value products for desert agriculture in Saudi Arabia. They align social, environmental and economic targets set by Saudi Arabia's vision and the Sustainable Development Goals. Founded by 4 young innovators from different backgrounds, their journey started in 2017 at King Abdullah University for Science and Technology (KAUST), where they built their first composting pilot facility and since then they have been testing and improving their processes and products taking advantage of the scientific expertise of their team and the KAUST core-labs facilities. In 2018, they won the SAAB-funded Taqadam accelerator program competition from a cohort of over 400 start-up teams from all across Saudi Arabia. In 2019, they expanded their composting operations and established strong relationships with key stakeholders and customer segments. In 2020, they obtained seed funding from the KAUST Innovation Fund and secured their first contract for designing, building and operating a commercial-scale composting facility with recycling capacity of 11,000 tonnes, which will become operational in Q3 2021 (August). By 2022 they expect to build 3 additional recycling facilities, and by 2025 their goal is to reach 3M tonnes of organic waste recycling capacity. Edama directly addresses food security, water scarcity and pollution issues.
Desert Compost is Edama's flagship product, designed to make sandy soils as fertile as they can be. It is made by recycling food waste from supermarkets, restaurants, commercial activities and households, combined with green waste from landscaping and farming activities. Healthy soils support more resilient and diverse plants in the short and long term, making farmers and landscapers' lives easier. As chemical inputs costs are reduced and yields increase, crop cultivation revenues are typically higher, which translates into increased profit for local farmers. Reduced water consumption translates into cost savings for the society, supporting local farmers, land developers and landscapers to comply with water use regulations and safeguard scarce freshwater resources. Desert Compost is a high quality product with better water retention properties, nutrient profile and benefits to soil structure and fertility than rival products in the market. Plants grown in sandy soil with compost have up to 500% higher yield using only 25% more water, which translates into 75% water use reduction for the same yield. Consistent results were found in tests with several crops including basil, tomatoes, bok choi, eggplants, okra, beans, squash. 
Other products the Edama team are developing includes date palm waste, which is a very abundant local feedstock. Currently, it is either burned or landfilled causing serious threats for the environment and public health. Because of its highly fibrous composition, it cannot be processed with normal composting techniques. At Edama, they developed treatments to convert date palm waste inputs into a valuable growth medium that supports water-efficient cultivation practices, drawing inspiration from a similar process used to convert coconut husks into coco peat, a soil input product produced in South East Asia. This is one of many new innovations and products Edama is working on.

Solution:
We use trawl-nets to collect plastics in bodies of water, then recycle these plastics into long lasting construction materials. This solution has an immediate impact and can be conducted in parallel with other actions focused on preventive measures with a longer term impact.
Innovation: 
A comprehensive solution that, for the first time, combines collection and recycling of plastic waste, with quite some novelty. For collection, we use trawl-nets that have been continuously improved over more than 20 years. They are now manufactured in Indonesia and made of neoprene to be high resistance and long-lasting. For recycling, we use an open-source process from Precious Plastic. Our team has developed a formula to transform mixed plastic waste into durable plastic planks. Introducing recycled-plastic planks to the South East Asian market will expand the possibility of plastic recycling, and encourage more sorting and recycling in the future. It is worth noting that the cost of producing plastic waste will diminish as the production scale increases. Due to its durability, it is suitable for tropical climates."

Ghasham is a Saudi inventor and science researcher. In 2017, he moved to Riyadh to study to become an Aircraft Technical Engineer. After moving to Riyadh, he noticed the number of coffee grounds being wasted in the cafes. This triggered him and was the drive for him to do something as his hometown of Rawdhat Sudair which is considered a farming community. From this stemmed Ghasham’s solution “Start Recycling” to recycle coffee grounds into fertilizers. He had started with one café in his hometown where he placed a shelf that customers who come to purchase coffee could also leave with a free fertilizer for their farm. His initiative grew covering 80% of his hometown cafes in the Sudair Region. Following the success in AlMajma’ah, Ghasham had aimed to expand to Riyadh. The need for the end-product in a city like Riyadh was low whereas a farming town had a need for fertilizers. This got Ghasham thinking of creating and testing an alternative product: Body scrubs and perfumes from coffee grounds which are coming soon. Ghasham is currently working on creating a Trading Plan in order to sustain his initiative. This includes thinking of ways to have his solution feed into the Saudi Green Initiative and the Middle East Green Initiative. Ghasham has been able to successfully partner with Cross Coffee in Riyadh (King Abdullah Road). He hopes to continue to form successful partnerships across the city of Riyadh. Ghasham’s initiative started from a social responsibility rather than a business motive. He had transferred the knowledge he had around recycling to the coffee shops to promote sustainability by giving them the know-how. Ghasham is also promoting women empowerment by collaborating with female farmers to produce body scrubs. To Ghasham’s knowledge, Saudi Arabia is considered one of the largest importers of coffee. Coffee shops are considered nowadays as a lifestyle in the Saudi community being a social hub rather than merely a means for coffee. Ghasham capitalized on this as an easy way to target and impact society .

Given the lack or scarcity of cooking fuels (wood, coal or gas) in the far north region of Cameroon, and the lack of autonomy among women, because women can no longer go about other occupations because they are constantly preparing. The problem of deforestation which is a direct impact on climate change. ASAAB which is an ultimate solution, is a non-electrical device with a cylindrical shape made from a fabric and several thermal insulators. It allows you to simmer good dishes of all kinds. To use the ASAAB cooker, a pot is first preheated normally to a fireplace (a stove, stove, wood or charcoal fireplace,..) to bring an initial cooking temperature for up to 10 minutes. At this stage, the pan or pot is removed from the fireplace and placed in the cooker where, due to insulation, the container remains close to the temperature at which it was removed from the fireplace for a period of time. The same goes for cold drinks.
After economic analysis, our ASAAB cooker is sold between 15000 FCFA and 25000 FCFA or between 23 £ and 39 £ about 33 US$ and 56 US$. On the other hand, the price of other thermal cookers already marketed is about 90 US$ and more or more than 40,500 FCFA.
TRL 7
About 100 samples sold out. Customer feedback is positive so far, as it permits women to multitask while cooking and has not risk of food or pot getting burnt. 
We know that a household gas cylinder costs 6,500FCFA. For a family of 4 to 5 people who use a gas cylinder per month, this amounts to 78,000 FCFA per year, or 780,000 FCFA for 10 years. With the faithful use of our ASAAB cooker, the family will end up with about a bottle for two months, due to the fact that it is used for cooking pot fire that is to say no frying just cooking done with water. The service life of asaab is about 10 years because of its insulating material. So the family will spend a bottle for two months will give 39,000 FCFA or 390,000 FCFA for 10 years with a saving of 195,000 FCFA. -Reduce evaporation compared to conventional cooking methods, which prevents food from burning or drying -Frees up time for women for other income-generating activities -Reduce deforestation and fight climate change -Allows cooking using less energy and does not pollute during its use -Significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions.

Descripción
Esta iniciativa se encuentra dentro del eje de Desarrollo Local de Migueleños en Acción. La asociación hasta el día de hoy cuenta con nueve año de experiencia, pero es a partir de la pandemia que el accionar de la asociación porque se tomó la decisión, desde la junta directiva, de comenzar a realizar consultorías y a ejecutar proyectos sociales para el desarrollo. El 2021 es como un parteaguas dentro de la vida de la asociación.
En marzo de 2021, Migueleños en Acción retoma una idea que habían venido concibiendo como parte de un comité de desarrollo local, que era considerado como un mecanismo de participación ciudadana contemplado en el Código Municipal. Durante muchísimos años no se había logrado alcanzar una apertura por parte de la municipalidad, entonces el año pasado se decidió cambiar esa situación y formar una mesa ciudadana que fue concebida como la Mesa Integral por el Desarrollo de San Miguel. Desde esta mesa, lo que se quiere es articular y potencializar las diferentes voces, opiniones, y acciones de vecinos y vecinas, representantes de juntas directivas o ADESCOS, de profesionales, y de otro montón de sectores que se encuentran operando dentro del territorio pero que no tenían un espacio para dialogar y consolidar intereses comunes en pro del desarrollo de San Miguel.
Muchas veces se tiene ese sesgo y el prejuicio de que las acciones políticas deben ser ejecutadas por partidos políticos, entonces con la mesa se ha buscado romper ese ese mito en función de que los habitantes puedan ejercer su ciudadanía como una forma de hacer política.
La mesa se reune una vez al mes. Y comienza como un espacio en el que se empieza a discutir principalmente sobre los problemas se tienen en San Miguel; problemas principalmente genera la misma población pero que pueden ser solventados por ellos mismos. Se empezó a hablar de diferentes temáticas: sobre el tráfico, casos de intolerancia en la calle, el desorden que existe en la ciudad a causa de las ventas informales que van ocupando las calles y aceras del centro histórico, se sacaron a colación problemas de agua, la mala distribución de la basura, y también se empezó a hablar sobre la el mantenimiento de la infraestructura vial.
Entonces esta iniciativa ha significado una oportunidad para que los migueleños puedan ejercer su ciudadanía activa y dialogar sobre las diversas problématicas que se tienen en la ciudad pero también estableciendo, de manera conjunta, cómo estas pueden ser solventadas.

""Do you want to learn how to grow wheat in the capital, Amman, from start to finish? Do you want to plant your wheat and have enough stock for about a year? Want to know the different products and foods we can make from wheat grain other than flour? Do you know that Jordan imports 97% of its wheat and grains needs and that it is the main source of energy and calories for Jordanians?""
With these questions Rabee Zureikat, founder of Zikra Initiative, started calling people in Amman to join a new project to grow wheat, inspired by the lockdown and necessity to have a stock of food to sustain oneself and family at all times.

""Our food is controlled from outside, and it is possible in any circumstance that we become deprived of it under political or other pressures. We do not have sovereignty over our food and the reason is simple because most of it is not produced in Jordan. For this reason, it is necessary to start thinking about how to produce our food ourselves by investing in the available resources.” Zureikat added.

In Bangladesh, an innovative startup called SolShare - has developed a renewable energy solution that connects solar-powered homes to the houses of neighbours who cannot afford a panel themselves, via a process known as swarm electrification. This enables the users of offgrid areas to generate not only electricity but also an income, using the power of the sun.

Since there is a gap between the demand and supply of freshwater, people often have no other choice but to use and drink unsafe water or spend their limited financial resources for transporting and purchasing clean drinking water. By using the unsafe pond water people frequently suffer from diarrhoea, dysentery, cholera, typhoid, worm infections and other waterborne diseases. On the other hand by drinking saline water they suffer from other diseases like hypertension, heart diseases, skin diseases, common cold etc. To mitigate these problems, the Bangladesh Government as well as some of the development sector organizations have come forward to help by installing deep underground water pumps in order to provide the inhabitants with fresh water. However, all of the projects undertaken to ensure safe drinking water are subsidized either by the NGOs or the Government fully or partially. GIZ Bangladesh is one of such organizations that has helped by installing deep underground and surface water pumps that are powered by renewable energy i.e., solar power under its Sustainable Energy for Development (SED) programme to ensuring safe drinking water. Since 2010 SED has supported the construction of 123 solar-powered water pumping facilities in South-west region, in Khulna, Satkhira, Bagerhat, Barguna and Pirojpur districts of the country.
Initial investment: BDT 1.7 million. Pricing: BDT 20-30 per HH/month
Ready
All the infrastructural and architectural designs have been approved by GIZ and excavation and installation works have been completed by the local vendors. After installation, GIZ appointed caretakers for respective pumps for maintenance and repair activities. These caretakers, other than maintaining the pump facilities, also collect the monthly subscription fees from the users/beneficiaries of the pumps and maintain records and accounts in a book. GIZ also formed a Project Management Committee (PMC) where there are representatives from the Govt. i.e., the UP Chairman as well as from the local communities i.e., users, local honorable personalities. PMC oversees the management of the pump and the distribution pipeline and helps caretaker resolve any disputes over fees collection. At present, from the 123 solar-powered water pumping facilities, 106 systems have been handed over to the community for operations. In most of these intervention areas, community is voluntarily managing the plant, with the support of UP representatives. T

The invention's goal is to use wine biomass as an energy resource, specifically to provide heat to buildings using this energy. This energy, along with other benefits, will help to mitigate the negative effects of climate change by lowering greenhouse gas emissions, reducing dependence on imported fossil fuels, and improving citizens' quality of life.
The invention works on the following principle: first, biomass should be collected during the wineyard pruning season (December - March) and then transported to the warehouse for drying and storage. Before the heating season begins (early autumn), the biomass is shredded, transported to the beneficiary as a final product and loaded into the heating system. The frequency with which the fuel is loaded into the heating system is determined by the volume of the storage/bunker. Biomass can be loaded once a week or once every two weeks.

Despite the external similarities with other vertical gardens, this construction has two innovative features, due to which it is the cheapest and most energy-efficient in the world - it reduces greenhouse heating costs by 4-5 times. This innovation is recognized by world-class experts. This project won two international competitions - IDEANCO and Launch Fort Harvesting Challenge. This construction has two know-hows: 1. The phytoblocks used to build the vertical farm have such a shape that they do not need a steel frame. Blocks hold each other. Only support poles are necessary, the rolls can also be made of plastic or with minimal metal reinforcement every 3-5 meters. This reduces the construction costs by 2-3 times, because the most expensive part of the construction is the steel frame, not the plastic blocks. 2. The shape of the blocks ensures the uniformity of the soil in the entire volume of the vertical farm. This makes it possible to grow not only greens and lettuce, but also vegetables that are difficult to grow in conventional vertical hydroponics - eggplant, bell pepper, etc. Because they have a genetic need to have a large volume of roots. In this way, the yield per square meter increases 4-5 times and, accordingly, the cost of heating the greenhouses is also reduced, because if the mentioned vegetables are planted in one layer on the soil in a normal greenhouse, 4-5 layers of phytoblocks will be placed on the same area in a vertical farm.
The cost of one phyto-block is 10 GEL on average, its filling with soil also costs about 10 GEL, and installation costs 2 GEL. Transportation depends on the distance and the maximum cost per unit in the territory of Georgia will be 1 GEL. Training will be provided for free.

Muhammad Yunus (founder)

Grameen Bank
In Bangladesh, Grameen Shakti has been actively working on Eco-Village Development (EVD) in three villages and also advocating EVD solutions in discussions of national energy and climate strategies. In this connection, Grameen Shakti has installed 1.7 million solar home systems, constructed 32,000 biogas plants, and one million improved cook stoves throughout Bangladesh during the last few years. The Eco-Village Development concept combines a number of solutions for poverty reduction within sustainable energy, water management, agriculture, gardening and housing. The solutions have all proven successful individually, but together they can provide the energy and resources needed for a development out of poverty for rural villages with minimal greenhouse emissions giving a prosperous vision for the future for rural areas. Individually the solutions can provide e.g. a cleaner cooking atmosphere, light or better gardening amongst others. Together they can fulfill basic needs and provide energy and resources for increased income generation. Furthermore, with the focus on local solutions EVD does not generate dependency on central supplies of e.g. electricity and fossil fuels where the supply is too often erratic and costly. EVD is more than a collection of sustainable solutions, as it includes installation of the right solutions for each area and village, according to the climate, livelihood and needs. In addition, it includes the integration of solutions and stepwise development, where the villagers gradually attain the solutions, as they are able to afford them and organize themselves to use them effectively. The solutions are not just technologies; they also include the training and support for permanent use and maintenance, as well as other frameworks such as funding mechanisms in order to have a long-term progression of living standards in a sustainable way. Grameen Shakti is highlighting EVD solutions in villages in the Manikganj District, about 50 km from Dhaka. Each of the villages has unique features in relation to usage of renewable energy technologies, demonstrating access to environmentally friendly energy as well as attaining a better standard of living. In off-grid villages like Khowamuri and Sudhkhira, the focus is on using solar home systems to provide electric power. People are also considering biogas plants and if a community-based biogas plant can be adopted. The village Ashulia is highly focused on biogas-based energy. There are several households in the village that raise cattle and poultry. Owners of the cattle farm sell milk in a nearby market, whereas owners of the poultry farm sell their chickens in large city. Cow-dung from the cattle farm and poultry litter from the poultry farm are used to produce biogas to be used for households as well as for cooking on the farms. The next step is to popularize the usage of bio-slurry as fertilizer. Comprehensive approaches to slurry usage as well as electricity generation from excess gas have been suggested in village discussions. Grameen Shakti has brought agriculture and biogas experts to the village to inform residents about better usage of slurry in the agricultural field and about quality of the slurry as organic fertilizer. Experts are considering introducing solar-based dryers to dehydrate slurry in an effort to obtain a higher, standardized nutrient content. Apart from the Solar Home Systems, Biogas Plants and Improved Cook Stoves the following village EVD solutions have been installed: Solar street light in off-grid Khowamuri village: 4 Solar street lights (20 Wp each) have been set up in the off-grid village Khowamuri for better movement and security. Meanwhile, the Government of Bangladesh has also taken a project to set up solar street light and Solar Home system in the village area under the project “Food for Work and Test Relief”. So, EVD solution is in lined with the country’s development strategies. Solar pump for clean drinking water and lighting in a primary school at Shudhkhira (Bokchor) village A Solar Water Pump for clean drinking water for a school in the village has been installed as it was well known that iron content is very high in the drinking water. Also a Solar System was installed and will run a 1 HP water pump and provide electricity (250 Watt) to the light and the fans in the class rooms. Bamboo cage for slurry-pit of biogas plant in Ashulia (Dermran) village: In the biogas village, the lack of slurry management is very common which is why a bamboo cage for open slurry pit has been adopted. The EVD intervention in Bangladesh has given the opportunity to bring integrated comprehensive sustainable village development to off-grid areas of Bangladesh. EVD model has given the villagers the opportunity to be integrated in the village development which is really a crucial issue in South Asia.

One fifth of Bangladesh floods annually during the monsoon season, but extreme floods cover up to two thirds, which are being exacerbated by climate change. In this context, Bangladeshi Architect Mohammed Rezwan came up with a creative solution ‘floating school’ to this problem. His organisation Shidhulai Swanirvar Sangstha operates classroom on boat, a school that gives to the student when the student can't go to school. The school-boat first serves as a school bus, making periodic stops to collect children from riverside stops. The boat then docks and class begins. In addition to a fleet of floating schools, the organization operates libraries, health clinics, playgrounds and floating training centres with wireless internet access, serving close to 122,000 people in flood-prone areas of Bangladesh. Sustainable agriculture: Floating training centers teach women and girls on new skills, sustainable agriculture, climate change adaptation, and women right. Climate adaptation: The farmer's floating farming helps landless farmers to grow vegetables and raise fish and ducks on river, that secure the income, food and employment throughout the year. Healthcare: With doctor on board, the floating health clinic moves across the waterways and docking at a riverside village the boat provide medical checkups. These initiatives allow people to access education and information, develop new skills, grow flood resistant crops and adapt to climate change."

The Problem
The Solution

Access to information, knowledge, connections, and opportunities continues to pose significant challenges for businesses in Bangladesh, hindering the growth of entrepreneurship in the country. The distribution of entrepreneurial knowledge and opportunities remains uneven and limited to a privileged few. There is a notable lack of coverage on topics such as business establishment in Bangladesh, local markets, emerging trends, prominent companies, and influential figures. Business education in Bangladesh also pays scant attention to the local entrepreneurship scene.
Entrepreneurship is a social phenomenon affected by numerous factors. Given the inherent difficulties involved in starting a business, young individuals seldom delve into studying local entrepreneurs. Moreover, societal attitudes often view entrepreneurs with skepticism, which discourages many from considering entrepreneurship as a viable career path.
Futures Startup is a free online knowledge platform that reports and publishes original in-depth insights, analyses, and inspiration concerning the business, technology, and entrepreneurship landscape in Bangladesh. This knowledge platform goes beyond conventional sources, providing a unique perspective that is not widely found elsewhere.

Kawon Cultural Library was created by Ghaith Bahdoosheh, a young man from the city of Madaba, Jordan. He started off with a mobile bookshop idea. He would drive around parts of Jordan in his old Mercedes, park, and set up his books on his car, and sell them to people. He dreamt of doing more related to books and reading and this eventually led to launching the social enterprise, Kawon. Brief about Kawon in his own words: Kawon Cultural Library is determined to become a daily place for locals to come to it, visitors from neighboring cities and tourists from all over the world, a place to dream and try to escape from the daily pressures of life and try something new, a comfortable place to meet your friends or read a book, all in one. With the increasing demand for high-quality coffee, food and great service, Kawon will benefit from its presence in the city of Madaba and the surrounding areas it serves, aiming to create a healthy environment, where cultural activities and knowledge exchange are the valves to evoke and spread new social values. 
Kawon brings a special experience of book culture to its visitors through its unique collection of books and publications in multiple languages. I made this library because of the lack of safe and cultural spaces that provide basic services to youth We aspire to achieve the developmental sustainability of our social enterprise by applying some of the concepts that will give us our independence, such as solar energy production and food production, both internally and externally. We aspire to be the pioneers in the field of rare and ancient publications, preserving them and re-publishing them to revive the written human heritage.

The Duke's Diwan is one of the oldest, well-preserved stone buildings located in the heart of Amman. Built in 1924 by Abdul Rahman Madi, the building served as the Central Post Office, and after 1948, it hosted the Haifa Hotel.
In 2001 it caught the attention of Mamdouh Bisharat, the ""Duke of Mukheibeh,"" who rented the house to protect it from destruction, with the aim of keeping the city's authenticity and character alive for Jordan's citizens and visitors.
Mamdouh converted the house on Faisal Str. into a Diwan, which traditionally means ""council chamber,"" where people, thinkers, poets and artists meet. The Diwan's doors are always open for visitors, as well as for talents in all fields of culture.
A descendant of one of the oldest families in Jordan, Mamdouh Bisharat has devoted his life to preserving architectural and cultural heritage in Jordan. His family house in Jabal al Jofeh, in Um al Kundum, and Mokheibeh to this day remain landmarks to be admired.

Description de Laafi Bag: Laafi Bag ou le « sac de santé » est un équipement autonome modèle sac à
dos réfrigérant qui fonctionne avec plusieurs sources d’énergie dont l’énergie photovoltaïque. Laafi Bag permet de transporter et de conserver les vaccins et produits pharmaceutiques à des températures entre -10 à 12oC. Laafi Bag
garantit ainsi la distribution des vaccins sans altération dans les zones les plus reculées du Burkina Faso, qui ne possèdent pas de moyens de conservations à basse température pour les vaccins et autres produits de santé. 
Caractères innovants de Laafi Bag : 1. C’est un équipement léger, autonome et équipé d’un module photovoltaïque pour
conserver et réguler la température en son sein afin d’acheminer les vaccins et autres produits sensibles dans les zones les plus critiques sans interruption de la chaîne du froid. 
2. Laafi Bag répond aux contraintes liées à l’ergonomie du sac mais aussi (et surtout) par rapport à son autonomie ; il
maintient la chaîne du froid sur une durée de 90h soit environ quatre jours, alors que les sacs semblables qui sont actuellement sur le marché “tiennent” entre 12 et 24h. 
3. La plus-value de l’invention et son impact social sur le développement des pays africains qui réussiront ainsi un des
défis majeurs qui est la lutte contre la mortalité infanto juvénile prolongeant ainsi l’espérance de vie des populations de manière générale. Dans le contexte de l’apparition de nouvelles maladies touchant le monde, il est impératif de
disposer d’équipements capables d’assurer l’acheminement, dans les conditions idéales, de futurs remèdes vers les zones les plus reculées d’Afrique et du monde.
4. Un système de monitoring basé sur plusieurs protocoles de communications et de géolocalisation est actuellement incorporé dans Laafi bag pour pouvoir localiser les agents de santé qui en sont munis et permettre de surveiller en temps réel les températures et les paramètres de fonctionnement. C'est alors un outil statistique de suivi et d'évaluation des opérations de vaccinations
Problème adressé: L'une des conditions d’une bonne conservation des vaccins est de les garder à des températures basses (2 à 8 oC). Cela est très souvent un écueil pour les services et les agents de santé d’un pays comme le Burkina Faso, où
les températures ambiantes varient entre 30 et 47 degrés et où certaines localités ne disposent pas encore d’installations électriques. Il est alors difficile d’assurer la qualité des vaccins par une bonne conservation.
Ainsi, en dépit de nombreuses campagnes de vaccination pour lutter contre des maladies infantiles comme la rougeole, la poliomyélite, la coqueluche, etc., l’acheminement des vaccins en zones rurales dépourvues d’électricité est souvent un parcours du combattant. Lorsque les vaccins sont transportés, il faut immédiatement les utiliser avant 24h ou 48h, sinon ils ne sont plus utilisables et donc inefficaces. De nombreux enfants sont non vaccinés dans les zones rurales, surtout
les plus reculées.Une telle situation explique que la mortalité infanto juvénile soit encore élevée surtout en milieu rural. L’OMS estime qu’un enfant sur cinq n’est pas vacciné et environ trois millions d’enfants meurent par manque de vaccination. Au Burkina Faso, le taux de mortalité infantile (0-1ans) est de 61 pour mille et celui de la mortalité infanto-juvénile (0-5 ans) est de 184 pour mille. 
C’est dire que ces enfants décèdent entre autres de maladies qui auraient pu être prévenues ou évitées par des vaccins. D'où l'idée de Laafi Bag pour apporter une conservation longue durée des vaccins. 
Impact
L'impact de Laafi Bag est de contribuer à assurer la bonne santé des communautés les plus vulnérables au Burkina Faso

My name is Kalil, When my holder brother and I were studying, we had as idea to create a little business from what we could pay all our bills. 2 years later, we were together graduated Engineers and like most of the cases in our country, it was like you spend all your time dreaming and you finalize by discovering that reallity is different. Those who used to support us now strart claiming from support in return. To be short, life while being student was very far from the reallity when we strart looking for job. Reverting on what we were saying, our first best idea was to manage the mobile money transfert. Full of confidence and faith, we agreed to go on. Whatever it be, we should not resign. 6 first months later we were still optimist to get it well going but one of the aspect that was playing against us, was the area where we decided to hold the business: the zone is full of people with low incomes. Facing that situation, we tried to see if we can find other option of developpment and we ended by proposing printing, copy, scanning services. Still things were not going well. My brother one day asked me to try if we can do an extra exercice and I just replied that it was impossible for me to do additional task as the existing one is not working. Let me tell you, I lost faith at that moment in the fact that one day things could change. He insisted and finally, told me that he has found the solution. For him, as we are dealing with an area with low incomes, we should do the things goin in the same direction so that the people will feel themselves part of our deal. 
What was his way to proceed? Just because of the fact that there is less incomes means they need to have services with low coast and almost all the services in our side that could interest them was claiming from them to have some level of digital litteracy and here is the deal. To realise the tasks, request is made for them to go out of their area side. So to solve that case, we have to give them a proximity solution. His proposition was then to build a mini computer center that could allow us to exploit the maximum of our capacity but also allow them to be part of a circular economy. That circulation could be defined as, they learn from us, use for their needs , produce and then come back to use the other services that was existing before. Wonderful!!! I said but internally i still not convinced by I just let him try. 
To build the center, we were confronted to find cheeper equipments so, we started by the place, we bluit the center with a 6 m2 metal box, 6 chaires and mini computer tables. About the electronics, we have purchased some old computers and used the FAN that is coming from old Air condition. How program is composed by Taptouch, Word, Excel Powerpoint and if requested, before Office training, we can teach some basic knowledge of windows. 
I am pleased to announce you that since we changed our strategy, we finally started receiving clients and some positive comment aboutthe fact that we are contributing to the developpement of the area side. Our particularity is that we are offering the service based on their finacial possibility. Up to today, we have more the 10 students willing to anounce in their networks the good vibes spreaded by the project."

PROBLEME ADRESSE : Easy school : LeSystème éducatif des pays en voie de développement fait face à de nombreuxdéfis qui limitent sa performance et les opportunités d'innovation. Parmi ces défis, il y a la problématique de l’accès à une éducation de qualité au profit de tous les apprenants dans un contexte marqué par l’insécurité liée au terrorisme et par la pandémie du Covid-19. Au Burkina Faso, des milliers
d’élèves sont mis sur le banc de touche du système éducatif classique. En raison de l’insécurité ambiante, on estime que plus de 256 000 enfants n’ont pas pu aller à l’école au cours de l’année scolaire 2019-2020. C’est une réalité vécue par plusieurs enfants dans plusieurs zones où la crise sécuritaire amène plusieurs enfants à être hors du système éducatif. Aussi, avec l’avènement du Covid-19 et dont les premiers cas ont été révélés au Burkina Faso en Mars 2020, les premières mesures prises par les autorités ont été la fermeture de toutes les écoles du pays.

Mr. R. M. Salunkhe, Dr. K. Dutta
Pune, Maharashtra,India
Profile Innovators Mr. R. M. Salunkhe and Dr. K. Dutta are from Pune district of Maharashtra. They are working with an NGO working for rural development through the implementation of innovative technologies in the field of non-conventional energy sources and agriculture. Purpose Mr. Salunkhe and Dr. Dutta have developed an innovative stove for fuel-saving, time-saving, and to improve the indoor air quality of the rural kitchen. Technical details The 'Sarai Stove' consists of four parts. All parts are made of mild steel. Combustion chamber: It is an open-ended cylinder, with an aluminum lining from inside. There is a door on the inside, and a series of holes along the periphery at the bottom. The holes serve as air inlets. There are two clamps on the side near the top for holding the outer jacket. Fuel holder This is a mild steel cylinder with an open top and a cast iron grate at the bottom. Solid fuel in the form of wood chips, coal, charcoal, biomass briquettes, etc. are placed in the holder, which in turn is placed inside the combustion chamber through its side door. Outer jacket It is an open-ended cylinder that fits on the top of the combustion chamber. There are two rows of holes circumscribing the cylinder near the top. Cooker with lid The cooker is a cylindrical vessel that can be inserted into the outer jacket, leaving an annular space of just about 2.5-3 mm between the walls of the two. It has a wide rim at the top, which seals up the annular space. The lid fits snugly into the open top of the cooker. To operate the stove, the fuel holder loaded with fuel is inserted into the combustion chamber. The outer jacket is fitted on to the chamber, and the cooker is inserted into it. About 200 ml of water is poured into the cooker and the cooking vessels are stacked in it, one on top of the other. The lid is closed and the fire is started. The air required for combustion of the fuel enters from the holes at the bottom of the combustion chamber and is sucked into the fuel stack through the grate at the bottom of the fuel holder. The hot gases and flames emitted by the fire pass through the annular space between the outer jacket and the cooker, and come out through the holes near the top of the outer jacket. The heat is conducted into the cooker through its bottom and walls and converts the water inside into the steam. The cooker fills up with steam and generates a sufficiently high temperature within the cooker to cook the food. Because of the fuel placed in the burner is limited, the stove extinguishes itself after a certain time. The food inside the vessel remains hot after the fire goes out due to the double jacket surrounding it. For frying or bread making, the outer jacket can be detached from the combustion chamber and the chamber can be used as a portable single pot stove. Performance The stove can be operated on any solid biomass fuel. Only 100 g of the charcoal is required to prepare food for 4-5 persons. The stove design is optimized for good combustion efficiency hence, cooking takes place in a smokeless environment. The outer jacket also can be used with a gas or kerosene stove, to increase fuel efficiency. Benefits The stove has higher fuel efficiency and it is smokeless. It increases the indoor air quality of the rural kitchen.

Water treatment, natural fertilizer

Inventor: Fatma Ali Elbanna (Student)
Although water makes up to 71% of the Earth’s surface, only 0.5% is fresh. Fresh water resources are getting exhausted at an exponential rate due to environmental changes, as well as the lack of sustainable planning. This project addresses three of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs); Clean Water and Sanitation (SDG 6), Affordable and Clean Energy (SDG 7), and Zero Hunger (SDG 2). People living in small towns or villages with no access to central services, will be the main beneficiaries of this project. The project is about developing a decentralized sewage unit for sewage purification for agricultural uses; the products are methane gas that serves as a source of energy, and agriculture fertilizers and water. The sewage bulk is filtered through a net, aerated, mixed with grinded moringa seed, and finally charcoal to remove color, taste, and odor. Moringa Oleifera (MO) is widely cultivated in Egypt; its seeds contain 35–40% oil, with potent antimicrobial activity as well as effective coagulant and heavy metal removal properties. The COD, BOD, TDS, and other bacterial count tests are carried out to ensure the suitability of the produced water for agriculture. Therefore, MO can be considered a natural and cheap alternative for chlorine and aluminum sulfate. Through this project, the sewage water treatment unit could be cost-effective and eco-friendly by sustaining the fresh drinking water and increasing the availability of agricultural water and natural safe fertilizers. This eventually leads to increasing crops production and supports the country’s economy.

The camp located in Ras Mohamed Nature Reserve in Egypt used a DIY lighting solution that helped guests staying at the camp to have some light at night while dinner is served.
The lighting unit used both repurposed materials like the plastic bottles used to get drinking water to the camp, natural material like sand found everywhere in the reserve to add weight to the unit, and an energy source the rechargeable led lamp. The end result is a lightweight portable lighting unit that can be easily moved around the camp and provide enough lighting to carry out minor tasks.
Access to light source
Camps located in the Nature reserve have limited access to resources like electricity as a result the Beduins that run the camps need to find solutions to work around the limitations to make sure they provide their guests with a comfortable stay while still taking care of the environment. Consequently, you would find many DIY versions of many amenities we take for granted in the city. The DIY versions more often than not are sustainable since they are considering the fact that resources are limited.

Santo Antão is the further Northwest island of the Cabo Verde archipelago. It’s an island known by its mountains, green valleys, rural tourism, trekking and delicious local food, but since 2017, Santo Antão has also became the heart of plastic recycling in Cabo Verde. This is the incredible story of Maria Teresa Segredo and the Netherlands Foundation “Amigos do Paúl” (Friends of Paúl).
Penedo is a small locality in the gateway to Janela area, after Santa Barbara tunnel for those traveling on the coastal road from the municipality of Porto Novo to Paúl. Arid, eminently a fishing village with some trade and few residents, Penedo is also the access to other touristic places in the region, like Ribeira and Fajã.
Since 2017 the area has gained another movement with the factory that is giving new life to plastics, turning them into tiles and helping to solve one of the environmental dramas in the country, which is the high use of plastic bottles ""PET"", which after use are thrown to the ground.
Each tile produced in Santo Antão uses eight plastic bottles and they are processed in this innovative recycling factory installed in Penedo. The factory directly employs 5 people and indirectly support many more that collect and deliver plastics from throughout the island, and have an installed capacity to produce up to 24.000 tiles made of plastic with different patterns. The project was promoted by Maria Segredo and the foundation “Amigos do Paúl” in the Netherlands, and was financed by the Dutch Cooperation through the University of TuDelf in Rotterdam.
In November 2018, the factory begun to supply local market with the plastic-made tiles. For the moment, the factory is only recycling “PET” material and producing 20x20 tiles for the construction industry and some decorative material. The acceptance now is good and the orders are increasing rapidly. Each box with 24 tiles costs 3,000 CVE (around 27 Euros) and the company is also exporting the product to the Netherlands, through a partner in that European country.
The project has awarded an ecological merit medal from the Municipality of Paúl.
On a daily basis, the company removes about 25 kilos of plastics from the environment and, in two years, has recycled more than 20 tons of garbage and produced more than 2,000 tiles, which are sold in the domestic market and also abroad. For the moment, the factory is only recycling PET material, but they have stored a large amount of plastic bags for “future experiences”.
Hirondino Silva, manager of the factory, says “often people come here and ask us for plastic bottles, because they say they can no longer find them anymore in the streets.” That’s the sign that our environment is cleaner"" he added. Santo Antão is benefiting from an environment more and more free from used plastic bottles, which are now harder to find.
To get all the plastic material they need, the factory promotes collection in hotels and restaurants throughout the island. Individuals and families are also gathering plastic bottles in their homes and neighborhood to deliver in the factory, and the company pays for it. There is a local young man that promotes plastic collection in the municipal waste landfill and in public gatherings and celebrations. There is also a focal point for plastic collection in the neighbor island São Vicente. Anyone who wants to send plastic to Penedo can reach the company through its phone contacts and Facebook page. The company can help with the logistics in sending the material, namely through the municipality environment services."

On the banks of the Rio Pongo, located a few kilometers from the city center of Kamsar, we discover before our eyes an idyllic scene with hyper-hurried ladies, men overloaded with basins at the edges of which we can identify the few lines of fish and seafood. It is in a good-natured atmosphere that we manage to collect a few words from our friend DAOUDA CAMARA fishing in deep water.
Like most of the unemployed young people of Kamsar, Daouda Camara found himself at a very critical moment in his life confronted with the fact of wanting to carve out a better future and at the same time provide his family with the minimum necessary for a living.
After his primary studies, Daouda was guided by the force of fate towards several types of odd jobs which ultimately remained without a favorable outcome. Always in search of a solution to his dilema, he quickly surrounded himself with a few friends who gave him the chance to enter their favorite exercise. This is how Daouda, a young resourceful man, will discover fishing boats, canoes and other traditional means of navigation at the heart of the port of Kamsar.
Our friend Daouda, day after day will end up enjoying it and will discover the wonders of fishing but also the constraints that go with it such as the level of coldness of the sea during the night, the difficulty of fishing and the scarcity of fish during the rainy seasons, very often the few losses of human life due to the sinking of boats of fortune.
According to Daouda, during his learning cycle, the biggest problem was the conservation of the fishing crops because, they had to quickly return to the surface to prevent the fish from rotting in the sea.
When the Senegalese fishermen arrived, Daouda and his friends had a chance to discover the ""YOLI"", a kind of traditional fishing boat made up of a very large canoe hull divided into several compartments including the 'front serving as a livewell hold, the middle serving as a transition between the front and the conservation hold. Speaking of conservation hold, here is one of the most innovative components of this traditional fishing boat because before its existence, fishermen like our friend Tinder beat each other up when they delayed at sea with the expiration of fish as an argument.
THE FAMOUS FLOATING freezer is a box whose walls are covered with glue based on liquid floats. In addition to this is added a cover made of polyester sleeping bag which finally makes the structure waterproof, allowing the fish to be kept this time for more than three weeks of duration on the sea. This makes the series of trips more than comfortable. Amadou and his family at sea. According to Amadou, after fishing, the contents of the boxes are distributed between them and the port manager in the following proportions: for each catch of three boxes, a half-box is intended for him. it will be remembered that in the event of an inconsistent setting, nothing is transmitted to him.
As it is often said, rural populations always have a solution to their problem.
From this solution of freezing over a long period, the fishermen act positively on the environment in the sense that they avoid letting empty bags inherit in nature which would probably push the residents to proceed with the calcination and thus pollute the environment. nature. For our Hero Daouda Camara, the conservation mode is more than beneficial since beyond the conservation of fish, without the need for a motor or battery; it offers them the possibility of reselling the residue of ice which is reusable to maintain the fish for the women going from the port to the various places of consumption or markets.

Description Tolbi provides real-time information for effective decision making on irrigation, disease management and yield forecasting to agricultural stakeholders especially small scale producers for a Climate-Smart Agriculture. e-Tolbi resides in the mash-up of global data (satellite images, research work, plant data sheets, diseases) with data related to the smallholder (credit history, property title, mobile money subscriber service, etc.) and data related to the farm (soil data, location, geography, history, etc.) to deliver highly accurate information, predictions and better decision-making for all stakeholders in the agricultural value chain. The data is collected by satellite, drones, from agricultural cooperatives, national agricultural agencies and then centralized through a platform to deliver real-time and reliable information to small farmers in local languages on IVR/SMS voice. This allows agricultural advisors and investors to be able to remotely monitor small farmers in real time through a web-based SAAS platform for accurate alerts and updates based on the data provided. Through the e-Tolbi marketplace, agregator companies, traders and supermarkets will be able to make pre-orders through yield forecasts based on machine learning algorithms and enable smallholders and their partners to sell at good prices and ensure early marketing. video link : https://youtu.be/W3oviAR0BVU
Challenges Small-scale farmers lose 60-80% of their irrigation water every day due to lack of water control. Late detection of diseases results in an estimated 30% loss of agricultural yield for small farmers. Microfinance institutes lack reliable information and data to set up financial insurance policies to allow small farmers to benefit from financing. They negatively impact the ability of small-scale farmers to innovate in production due to lack of means and to obtain optimal yields due to losses and poor water management.
Insights Tolbi aims to enable small-scale producers to access different services such as production-related services (from the pre-harvest phase to the post-harvest phase to assist and advise them on best practices to combat diseases that can hinder production), finance-related services with detailed field data that can help credit companies to build a reliable credit profile and deliver loans to smallholder farmers more easily, trade and market-related services by facilitating linkages with stakeholders and access to information on best prices, and services related to subscriptions to the cooperative (member management with CRM, distributed communications. .). e-Tobli's services will enable small farmers to take advantage of technological innovations (drone, artificial intelligence, IoT, satellite) with adapted IVR interfaces in local languages and voice SMS for women and illiterate youth and a mobile application for those who are better equipped and also considerably increase their income with accurate information on the agricultural health (disease, weeds), exact needs for water and fertilization as well as forecasts of harvest periods to aid production-related planning."

Problem: There was inadequate management of the forest within this partiality (communal land). There were forest fires, overgrazing, excessive felling of trees for firewood and commercialization, contamination of the area and fragmentation of the forest. All these situations in turn influenced that the collection and quality of water began to decrease.
Solution: A society was established where the tasks of caring for the forest could be distributed, inculcating activities such as: thinning, cleaning, sustainable logging, reforestation, maintenance of the greenhouse, among others. This with the aim of increasing water collection and quality."

Access to affordable housing remains a major challenge for many poor communities in Eswatini. The Mgidza informal settlement in Vuvulane with a total of over 27 households is one such community whose homes are constructed mostly of stick and mud and present a health and safety hazard for its residents, including children. This is one of five informal communities located in the Farming town of Vuvulane. The Informal settlements supply labour to the sugarcane farmers who either do not make enough from their revenues to provide their workers with proper housing or elect not to do so. The result is that informal workers and their families must resort to building make-shift, usually one or two-roomed houses using local materials like stick, mud and grass that are shared by whole families, as they also do not have land rights to allow them to build more permanent structures. This problem is widespread across the 5 farming communities in Vuvulane and is a common feature across the rural poor. This solution is shared by a locally based education center focused on promoting sustainable living called Gubha. 
Traditionally, Swati homes are made of natural building materials, mostly lutindzi grass, reeds, sticks, stones and mud. These home structures have excellent thermal properties, allowing for a pleasant stay throughout the seasons. The cutting of the grass and reeds is seasonal, to allow for nature to regenerate and provide consistently. Floors are rammed earth with a top coating of wood ash and cow dung. It is important to note that traditional African or Swati architecture has always been environmentally conscious, using what is available within the landscape. It is unfortunate that such indigenous knowledge, in architecture, was neglected for a long time, labelled as primitive and a symbol of poverty, thus giving way to ‘modern’ architectural methods that have mostly been working against nature (i.e. requiring artificial means of temperature control) and are generally more expensive.
The Low Cost High Quality Eco Housing solution, tries to utilise these traditional methods to construct modern, sustainable and affordable housing solutions. This sustainable housing solution aims to provide affordable housing solutions to the poor using locally available and affordable materials. 
The house is made of compressed mud bricks (made by the community from red earth, dug on site, and a mixture of river sand, small amounts of cement) that provide good insulation, thus reducing the energy costs for running them. A wood sawdust bucket compost toilet has been featured, thus reducing the need for solid waste plumbing and unnecessary wasting of water. The construction of up-cycled pallet wooden framed windows with shutters and mosquito nets allows for cross ventilation day and night with no fear of mosquitos penetrating. The window opening has been deliberately made small in width so that burglars cannot enter through it when it is open. Natural airflow and natural light have been considered in the design as the area experiences very hot summers and cold winters.
On one of their solution mapping safaris, the AccLab found this solution to be shared by two locally based NGOs focused on sustainable living, one being the Vuvulane orphans and Vulnerable Children’s Outreach Foundation (VOVCOF) and the Gubha Permaculture Education Center "

However, when COVID hit, such traditional methods gained some popularity. this solution therefore was developed to meet the growing demand for steaming needs around the country with the aim of reducing accidents associatedwith traditional steaming from an open pot or basin."

As the world continues to call for climate action and protecting the environment, the re-use or upcycling of non-biodegradable material remains essential. 90% of the rural population in Eswatini, uses fuel wood as the main source of fuel for domestic purposes (particularly cooking, heating and water heating). As a result, more trees are being cut down leading to erosion the destruction of habitats for wild animals. For the Mbuluzi Game Reserve, like most rural communities, access to modern energy services such as electricity especially for water heating purposes, remains a challenge as modern energy services such as electricity and gas are very expensive, yet the need to sustainably use forest resources remains a high priority. This solution was designed to meet this need while ensuring the sustainable use of natural resources.
The solution was developed by the Mbuluzi Game Reserve Manager working with a local artisan (welder) to provide an energy-efficient, affordable off- normally heated more water than required and needed more fuel wood. This solution provided a more sustainable option which was affordable and easy to make with basic artisan skills. It adapted existing technologies to produce a solution that fits the needs of the Game Reserve, but that could easily serve the needs of households.
Mbuluzi Game Reserve is based in the Lubombo region of Eswatini, and its main aim is to conserve the country’s biodiversity. One of the tourism services offered by the facility in addition to accommodation is a camping facility. Initially, the camp site used a large wood-powered boiler system to heat water for its campers. However, this system proved inefficient and time-consuming as it required a lot of wood even if there were only two campers in the facility. This created the need for a more efficient off-grid system. This solution therefore aims to minimise the use of fuel wood resources to conserve the country’s bio-biodiversity. The water heating system can be made with scrap materials and requires minimum technical skills and can be easily made by local welders.
The main objectives of the water heater solution are:
- Provision of an affordable (uses scrap material), energy efficient (uses less than a third of the firewood that was used for the old system), easy to make and maintain (has no moving parts), and timesaving (heats water faster) water heating system
- Provision of opportunities for upcycling scrap metal (from near-by mills),
- Reduced negative impact on natural biodiversity (particularly the flora or forest), and
Reducing the risk of forest fires through a nearly enclosed system.

The water heating system is made up of discarded scrap metals from the nearby sugar factory. The system was designed and fabricated by the Game Ranger and a local retired welder. The structure constitutes of a concrete small shelter to protect the fire word from rain, a small oven-like fire box, a water cylinder, cold water inlet and hot water (shower) outlet. The structure is also fitted with a safety valve to release excess heat/ pressure should it get too hot, as a safety measure.
The system can be used for multiple purposes, e.g., cooking and heating, and possibly baking as it has the properties of an oven, making it easier for campers to prepare food.
What has made it successful is its low cost, use of reclaimed materials, ease of development and opportunity to provide a livelihood. The artisan who fabricates it is now able to make a living out of it."

Iraq's First and Largest Assembly of Amateur Football Players
The Problem:
The Solution (Laoob Application):

1- Lack of Proper Coaching and Equipment: Many aspiring amateur football players in Iraq lack access to proper coaching and basic equipment. This deficiency in resources hinders their development and growth in the sport.
2- Limited Financial Support: Financial support for amateur players is limited, making it difficult for them to afford necessary training, equipment, and participation in competitive events. 
3- Media Visibility and Recognition: The lack of media attention and spotlight on amateur players in local teams prevents their talent from being recognized and acknowledged. This lack of visibility impacts their chances for growth and potential professional opportunities. 
4- Disconnect with Talent Scouts: There is a significant disconnect between amateur football players and talent scouts. This communication gap, compounded by the absence of effective channels like social media, irregular competitive events, and potential inequalities, prevents talented players from being discovered and nurtured.
5- Infrastructure Challenges: While playgrounds are available in most Iraqi cities, challenges exist in securing access. High demand, lack of proper scheduling systems, difficulties in reaching playground owners, and inconsistent maintenance can hinder players' ability to use these facilities effectively.
6- Self-Funding and Playground Reservations: Local teams in Iraq are often self-funded and must pay to reserve playgrounds for matches. The process of reserving preferred time slots, accessing owners, and dealing with inconsistent maintenance can be cumbersome and impact team activities. 
7- Unregistered Amateur Players: A significant number of amateur football players in Iraq (more than one million) are not registered with the Iraqi Football Association. This lack of formal registration can limit their opportunities for organized play and recognition. 
8- Uneven Quality of Facilities: While playgrounds are available, the quality of these facilities can vary across different districts, affecting the overall playing experience and skill development of players. 
9- Inequality and Corruption: There is a potential for inequality and corruption that may prevent talented players from being recognized, further exacerbating the challenges of talent development and growth. 
10- Competitive Opportunities: The irregularity of competitive events organized by talent scouts/clubs can limit players' chances to showcase their skills and potential for professional football.
Laoob, a name derived from the Arabic word meaning ""skilled player,"" is a one-stop-shop for amateur football players in Iraq. The platform connects these players and fosters a community, providing opportunities to improve their skills and pursue their aspirations of becoming professional footballers. In addition, Laoob streamlines the reservation issues of local football playgrounds.

1- Player profiles: a complete player profile, featuring personal information, technical and physical details, match statistics, and evaluations from peers and coaches.
2- Matchmaking: The platform links amateur football players with talent scouts.
3- Match scheduling: players can create and organize matches with one another.
4- Playground reservations: players can easily browse stadiums, learn about the services provided, and select a convenient day and time for reservation through a seamless process.
5- Talent evaluations: utilizing technology, the platform organizes performance trials to evaluate, select, and promote talented players to clubs in Iraq and abroad.

Transforming biomaterial waste to biodegradable packaging

Substrato is a project that transforms agroindustrial waste into biomaterials that can be applied to developing sustainable products. This is achieved thanks to a multidisciplinary process that connects the field with creative and innovative methodologies and local knowledge and infrastructure.
This project was born as an academic exploration that arises from investigating and analyzing agro-industrial residues in Mexico to develop new alternatives for its use and management. This, in turn, implies the development of sustainable products that demonstrate the economic value of organic waste.
The research focused on pineapple leaves, the primary residue in producing this fruit, representing 75% of the harvested product. The waste that served as raw material for the project's development was obtained from Ciudad Isla, Veracruz, one of the key pineapple-producing states in Mexico.From the experiment, four biomaterials were developed (felt, bioplastic, chipboard, and rope), and some applications of the materials made of fiber and pineapple leaf bagasse.

suffering from for the ten years and as the sanction were heavily applied on
the Syrian government, a new dilemma has occurred with the shortage of several
resources of energy such as petroleum and Gasoline. 
Consequently, Gas stations lack Benzine and
people had to wait for days on the line to fill their cars, 
During the last three months, Damascus- as most
of Syrian governorates-, roads look like nets of line of cars standing along hundreds
of meters and remaining for days, 
Therefore, filling the cars and finding
solutions for the current circumstances became the first obsession and main discussion
topic of the society.
People started to comply and adapt with the situation
and succeeded to show great level of resilience 
Waiting for their turns at the Gas station
became social gathering and a picnic including food and drinks, 
One solution that people have came up with to support each other,
that the ones who enjoys better financial
situation are hiring young men and unemployed men to take their cars and wait
on the rues instead of them and pay them in exchange of this service, This way people who suffers from bad financial sutuation and unemployeed men are gaining some money in exchange to their services.
Despite the fact that, this is not an
innovative solution that involves investment of available resources or even
grasshopper solutions , but from my direct observation and what I am hearing
from the community around me , I found that this way od adaptation and sometimes
manipulation of the existing reality and harsh difficulties that my community
is facing can be called a solution and would be considered as social integration solution approach.
Another creative solution that my community has
came up with using their resources f Social networking and facebook, that a
group of people from all over the districts of Damascus created website and a
page on facebook called “ وين عبيت "" Where did you fill” which is a participatory page that inform
people about the available , opened and closed Gas stations with full information
and guidance on the better stations to head to, 24/7 and to inform people about
the time estimated for the waiting duration over each gas station, all needed information in this regard are
provided through this site and page.
The page news spread every where very quickly ,
ill it became a social supporting tool for people who needs to fill their cars.
Youngsters knowledge and skills were invested and people have coordinated
together in order to support each others.
The need of basic resouces such as fuel and transportation which affexts all other aspoects of the Syrian Habitants' Daily life and even prevent Taxi and bus drivers from their income.
The lesson to learn , is that community has the power to coordinate together and find alternatives and solutions, Social Cohesion awareness and support is essential during and after crisis."

L’objectif de la technologie La problématique réside dans la limite de traitement par le sol traditionnel, on constate souvent que les champs d’épuration conventionnels (lit ou tranché d’infiltration, filtre à sable...) peuvent se fatiguer et se colmater pour plusieurs raisons : 1- une mauvaise distribution d’eau à traiter : soit latéral (un déséquilibre entre les conduites perforées), soit longitudinal, car on constate souvent que les conduites d’épandage classique ont du mal à acheminer l’eau à traiter jusqu’au bout du filtre. D’où la difficulté des systèmes classiques d’utiliser l’ensemble de la surface de traitement définie à l’origine. 2- Manque d’oxygénation : cela peut être causé par un recouvrement du système avec un matériau inadapté ou par une hauteur trop importante du remblai. 3- La granulométrie du sable : la granulométrie du sable et sa qualité ont un impact très important sur la performance du système de traitement. Il faut mentionner que ces systèmes de traitement classiques peuvent difficilement relancer leur efficacité en cas de problème. Il faut parler aussi de leur manque de flexibilité lors des installations (systèmes en pente, en couloir, en coude...etc.) L’objectif des solutions System O)) est de reprendre les principes de base et naturels de traitement des eaux usées afin de protéger le milieu récepteur tout en remédiant aux problèmes cités plus haut.

In Ho Chi Minh City, it is estimated that there are about 4,000 visually impaired people, many of whom have become role models for their energy, passion and contributions to society. Despite their own efforts and the support of the government and community organizations, visually impaired people still face many challenges in learning, employment, community integration and creating a stable life. Part of this is social stigma, and part is the lack of caring for blind and visually impaired people in general. Job training and creating stable jobs for blind people is limited in Ho Chi Minh City. A current survey revealed that in Vietnam, just only 6.3% of visually impaired and blind people are employed. However for many other blind and visually impaired, the “work” is still mainly unskilled labour and the average monthly income remains low. We at Noir. Dining in the Dark, have opened the door to another career for the blind and visually impaired. Through our innovative training techniques, we improve these talented individuals’ self confidence and career trajectory. We are proud to put them in a position where they assume responsibility for our guests and a transfer of trust is the norm. Since we began this business, we have been inspired by visually impaired and blind people and we are dedicated to the blind community. A certain percentage of our profits will be donated to charities which work with local blind and visually impaired people, including organizations which provide operations to restore sight to visually impaired children. 
Think of modern society and images of shining cities and glowing screens come to mind. Every facet of daily life depends on sight. How would your other senses react to being in complete darkness? At Noir. Dining in the Dark, you will embark on a sensory journey into a different world and savour exquisite tastes and textures in complete darkness. This multi-sensory dining experience will stimulate your senses and open your mind. The experience begins in our pitch black dining room where you will be guided and served by blind or visually impaired staff who have been specially trained to assist and reassure sighted guests who are in complete darkness. Transfer your trust to these skilled guides they lead you to experience a new way of sensing the environment around you. After a few moments of adjustment, the darkness will kill off any shyness or trepidation and bring about an open-minded atmosphere. Our unique menus are a symphony of flavours. And will stimulate your other senses as you are deprived of the dominating sense of sight. Textures and subtle flavours will come to the forefront as you dine your way through unique dishes that have not been described beforehand. You will discover the stunning truth that people tend to experience food with their eyes, rather than with their palates. At Noir. Dining in the Dark, it is more than just a meal. It is a sensory journey that will make you re-evaluate your perception of taste and smell. Be one of the first to try this one-of-a-kind dining experience for a unique date or group outing in Saigon.
OUR TEAM
This has been an experience of people's lives and values.
It has been around four months since we got connected to our future team through the Blind Association Centre. During the job interviews, they have completely eliminated our original concerns about starting a new career in hospitality. They told us inspiring stories of their extraordinary energy, tenacity; about faith, optimism and their values.
They have indeed motivated and inspired us to develop this concept, a concept to help people experience their other senses through dining. This social business will help and boost awareness toward the visually impaired and blind community in the region. And then the first restaurant with the concept Dining in the Dark in Saigon was born, called Noir. Dining in the Dark.
From the first days of training until today, we have learned to live and to experience their world for a better understanding of their lives. For them, it is a doorway to the field of hospitality service excellence. What is wine? How wine is fermented? What is the shape of an artichoke? What does it smell like? What colour is it? Why there are so many types of glasses? Why is a dessert spoon smaller than a tablespoon? In the dark, why do we need to smile when talking with guests? Or why do we need to iron the napkins when the guests cannot even see it? Why does a dish have so many spices and herbs?
Thousands of questions, hundreds of hours of training, and a new world gradually opened up to them and also to all of us. Now, they are fully equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills to perform their job and are ready to welcome the first guests with a most positive attitude and excitement.
We are really proud of our team, because they are the ones who make the difference."

Greening of roofs of the buildings
(NGO “Pukhovichskiy Krai”)
A methodology for greening of the roof for 1-2
storeyed buildings was developed and piloted on
a real site in order to introduce this into practice of
low-rise urban buildings design and construction.
This was implemented within the framework of the
pilot initiative implemented in Pukhovichi district,
Minsk region, by NGO “Pukhovichskiy Krai” from
January 2015 to September 2017. The methodology
of Greening the roofs of the buildings is stipulated
in Annex 1 to this report. The accessible roof of
the greenhouse building of gymnasium No. 5 in
Maryina Gorka town, Puchovichi district, became
the pilot site.
As a result of the implementation of the pilot
initiative, the following was achieved:
- the existing greenhouse building was
examined;
- the concept for greening the roof of the
building was developed by a Polish expert;
- design estimates for the reconstruction of the
roof of the greenhouse building was developed;
- construction and installation works were
carried out to insulate the roof, organize the
drainage system, two irrigation systems, etc. A
typical extensive roof with an 18 cm. soil layer
was constructed with two irrigation systems (drip
and sprinkler), an automatic soil moisture control
system (when the level of moisture is optimal, the
irrigation system automatically turns off , in case
of rainy weather, irrigation systems are inactive),
a two-layer system drainage (drainage of surface
water and separate drainage of water absorbed
into the soil), a slight slope, perimeter fencing and
lighting, reinforcement of the roof deck, allowing
to carry load of 500 kg/m2 at the weakest point,
of which 200 kg/m2 – is the snow load. Thus, the
structural features of the roof allow it to be used
by a lot of people at the same time; however, the
plans of the Maryina Gorka gymnasium provide for
the presence of groups of up to 5 children on the
roof under the supervision of a teacher;
- specialists were trained in new green
technologies. 3 people were trained during a
study visit to the Republic of Poland in May 2016.
2 people introduced the fi rst green roof in the
Republic of Belarus at the 6th Moscow International
Garden and Flower Festival on 4-6 July 2017.
The methodic of greening and functioning of its systems was tested during Spring, Summer, and Autumn. In Winter the roof don't needs the snow removal.
The report on this innovation was broadcasted. Meet Sergei Zinkevich, the DIrector of Maryina Gorka Gimnasium, where the green roof is situated

Javier Brolo and María Inés Castañeda on May 13th, 2021
If a person previously separates its household waste and leaves it separated before garbage collection, then the garbage collector will keep it separated when picking it up.
Household garbage classification 
May 10th, 2021
Separate the garbage of the house using at least three categories: carton/paper, glass, and plastics. Put each one in a different plastic bag. Then, put the classified bags outside of the house and wait and see what does the garbage collector do. Observe and annotate whether the garbage collector keeps the bags divided or mixes them up. Take pictures or videos only if it is not intrusive. Annotate ideas and insights. Don't talk directly to the collector, just watch and learn.
Household garbage, garbage bags, garbage collector, cellphone or camera
No additional comments.
The garbage truck does not go inside the street's house. Instead, on behalf of the truck, a collector man goes throughout the street with a medium cart to pick up the neighbors’ garbage bags. When the collector picked up the bags, he joined them into one. He did not keep the bags separated. Next, he put that one mixed bag on top of the others ones on the cart. 
Since the collector has to use a cart for moving the garbage maybe it is easier for him to merge the bags. We wonder whether he separates the bags again once he is back at the main garbage truck. We also ask ourselves if this is a common practice in other areas of the city. What do other garbage collectors do when they find separated garbage on their routes? Are there any garbage collectors who do keep separated the garbage and why? 
We could do a second trial of the experiment and in addition to the observation we could talk to the garbage collector and ask whether he considers the separated garbage is useful and if so, why and to whom is it useful?
1 day
We will try to invite country office colleagues to replicate the experiment at their homes and record their results and insights in order to see how experiences vary throughout the city.

Javier Brolo and María Inés Castañeda on June 18th, 2021
IF information on CPD is transferred to an alternative way of communication -a Mural- THEN it will be easier to make sense and give coherence to the big amount of information on the CPD regarding the systemic strategy of UNDP towards attaining human and sustainable development.
Alternative means to communicate effectively dense information
June, 2021
For this experiment an inductive analysis was employed through 4 main steps. (1) First we read the CPD in detail in order to identify cause and effect relationships implicitly stated on each paragraph. We considered as ""cause"" those elements linked to any expected result or effect, including lines of action. As ""effect"" we considered those elements that are expected to happen in consequence of a cause. It is important to note that some cause and effect relationships are bounded. In other words, some causes have effects which are also causes of other ulterior effects. That is why the categorization of an element as a cause or an effect was given by context and was not by any means absolute. (2) We grouped the cause and effect relationships found according to similarities perceived among the lines of action. From this iterative grouping process a pattern emerged which let us rank the lines of action from those more oriented towards institutional strengthening to those most oriented towards society strengthening, passing through institutional and society coordination. This pattern is not the only one possible, however, it is the one that let us make sense of all the information analyzed. (3) We proposed labels to name the groups of cause and effect relationships. Three main groups were identified, each one having other subgroups. (4) On the basis of the aforementioned main groups a general hypothesis was proposed with three additional derived hypothesis (this will be presented on the results).
Mural; CPD document
No additional comments
Through the analysis we identified one central hypothesis and three derived hypothesis about UNDP's intended contributions towards development based on the lines of action proposed on the CPD. The central hypothesis identified is: 1. (x1) strong institutions, (x2) institutional coordination, and (x3) strong society influence positively on (y1) development. [x1 + x2 + x3 = y1] From the central hypothesis, three additional hypothesis are derived: A. (x1) Procedures, (x2) technical abilities, (x3) knowledge management, and (x4) technology contribute to (y1) strenghtening institutions. [x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = y1] B. (x1) inter-institutional mechanisms, (x2) mechanisms among national and local level institutions, and (x3) mechanisms among local institutions contribute to (y1) effective institutional coordination C. (x1) dialogue mechanisms, (x2) citizenship participation, (x3) economic empowerment, and (x4) social inclusion contribute to (y1) strong society
We consider that this analysis might be useful to make sense of the CPD through a way which is easy to remember and repeat. This can be useful to socialize and help appropriate the CPD both at an internal level in the country office and also at external levels including audiences that are not experts on development topics. On the other hand, from the Accelerator Lab standpoint, this analysis lets us identify more clearly which are some of the assumptions or mechanisms used on the lines of action that can be tested through experiments. Also, this analysis is linked to our learning cycle on knowledge management, letting us learn whether this kind of analysis helps to understand and give coherence to the huge amount of information on the UNDP's systemic strategy to contribute on human sustainable development gathered on the CPD.
As noted on the design, since this analysis was an inductive process it is important to keep in mind that other patterns may be possible.
Approximately 3 weeks.
We shared the results with the Monitoring and Evaluation Officer at the country office. Right now we have ongoing meetings to discuss it, examine it, answer questions, validate it and identify opportunities to test its usefulness.

His name is Oumar CAMARA, grew up in Sierra Léon and has joinned Guinea a decade before. from this picture, we see a single and simple man but when we try to discuss and go a little bit deeper, we discover the other side of the isberg hidden by the wall of modesty. Let's together read the story of Oumar, our former english teacher transformed throught the impact of covid-19 to an isolant seller.
Oumar Camara has started to monetize his knowledge of english in a school in the city of Kamsar where at the begining, everything was fine and with the time, he took advantage of the fact that Guinea scholarship is less expensive and the program spread the taught program has a shortfall in English. However, we will remember that for the years felt, the government of the Republic of Guinea has focused heavily on strengthening the training capacity of teachers and on the other hand is the need for a professional working language where it was introduced. idea of ​​ensuring that children from elementary school can start studying this language very early. It is therefore in this momentum that our friend Oumar CAMARA has established himself. 
And as we know in any case there are ups and downs, our friend Oumar after this good period of grace began to have delays on the wages which was due for the work done despite all the revision and proposal of Alleviation of payment for management hardly changed anything. In the end, he even deduced that it was the management that refused. While the latter gave every effort to be able to respect its commitment and ensure that the damage is minimized. Against all expectations, the covid-19 pendemic has upset the majority of our abitudes and even the most fundamental such as the payment of schooling due to the closure of many businesses and restrictions on motion to certain destinations.
Faced with all these elements which constitute a strong alibi of disuasion to remain indulgent. not long after, Oumar by a coup de grace, found himself promoted to the post of director. From that moment on, Oumar said he was able to quickly receive his salary (s) given that the arrears were a significant portion. On the strength of his new position, Oumar was surprised by the parents' non-reaction to his appeal for payment of school fees. As we raise the curtain on a surprising situation, Oumar suffered a big shock when he finally realized that all this time he was struggling to warm up the management when the reality was totally different. After several recall attempts, he was forced to throw in the towel. Nothing more could be added to it. This is how our friend finds himself in search of a solution to meet his needs and ends up realizing and admitting that everything had to be redone. Surrounded by his friends and brothers, he receives some suggestions of resilience in the face of this lean cow situation among which he brilliantly welcomes the idea of ​​trying his luck in the sale of protective plastics normally intended to pack televisions and other equipment. classified very fragile. In any case, we call it a ""float"" because of its property of floating on liquid surfaces. 
According to Oumar, the sale of insulation is very easy and quick in terms of generating money as it allows him to earn between 900,000 and 1,500,000 gnf on average and per month, which is much better compared to his old profile. Oumar uses his links in conakry for its supply by isolating collected from repair shops for electronic equipment and or from surrounding markets where the majority of insulation is collected as soon as the freezer boxes and others are opened without forgetting the fact that he makes great use of his fraternal relationships to expand his network of suppliers. Fortunately for him up to this day, everything is going very well. Oumar often pauses the question if for him although the Corona Virus is a difficult burden for all humanity, the fact remains that for him and some of his condition in particular it is rather a solution that has arrived at the right time?
so we wonder, but what is the use of the insulation or floats sold by our friend?
Well behave yourself because, the fishermen rush to the lots of floats to use it, once mixed with oil which gives a sticky and opaque mixture that does not let the water pass under any pretex. In short, it is a perfect element which spread over the sides of the boat, prevents water penetration. AND for our friend Oumar, this is a real positive means of recycling that we could well popularize in order to contribute to the good behavior of the environment.
It is therefore on this end note that Oumar CAMARA gratifies us with this smile while hoping to tell us the rest of his story which according to him must necessarily have a future extract retracing his return to teaching because for him ""TEACHING"" is the best commitment we can make to the community that has given us everything.

Interestingly enough, when I approached another counter where sales team had the same sharpener, they said they bought hangers for the plastic bags. This shows how people have a different viewpoint towards the same object.
This idea does not necessarily answer a need, but shows how people re-use common every day objects.
The lesson of this example is how people approach same common objects in a different way. For example, this shop was the only one that was using the knife sharpener as a hanger even though most shops had the same knife sharpener."

dans le cadre de la lutte contre la propagation de la Covid-19. Mais le respect de cette mesure s’avère parfois difficile, car dans la culture africaine et celle béninoise en particulier, les populations sont habituées à vivre en communauté avec des relations sociales très étroites : une tendance à aller saluer la famille, les malades, à manger ensemble dans le même plat, à participer à des réjouissances (mariage, baptême, etc.) ou à des cérémonies funéraires. Dans un tel contexte, le respect de la distanciation physique reste un défi en dépit des sensibilisations.
Le Laboratoire d’Accélération du PNUD a collaboré avec une start-up béninoise pour développer une solution peu onéreuse, inclusive et à la portée de tout détenteur d’un téléphone portable. Il s’agit d’une application fonctionnant avec la technologie Bluetooth dénommée « Stop Covid-19 », qui comprend des modules distincts. En effet, via la technologie Bluetooth, elle permet de déterminer de façon précise si deux ou plusieurs personnes ne respectent pas la mesure de distanciation physique (rester à au moins 1 mètre de distance les uns des autres) et génère automatiquement des alertes sur leurs téléphones via des notifications claires (sonores et sms) leur indiquant le non-respect de cette mesure dans des langues de leur choix dont des langues nationales parlées dans diverses parties du pays.
Ainsi, en cas de non-respect de la distanciation physique, l’alerte sonore suivante se déclenche sur le téléphone portable : « Attention ! Veuillez reculer ! ». Le message d’alerte est selon le choix de l'utilisateur, en français, ou en anglais ou en langue locale jusqu’à ce que l’intéressé prenne ses distances. Dès que l’on se retrouve à au moins un mètre d’un autre individu, le message vocal suivant résonne : « Merci, vous êtes à une distance raisonnable ! ».
Par ailleurs, l’application est associée à une plateforme web accessible de façon sécurisée fournissant en temps réel
l’historique des individus avec lesquels une personne est rentrée en contact (restée à moins d’un mètre). Aussi, est-elle également dotée d’un moteur central pouvant fournir des statistiques et, en cas de besoin, l’historique de toutes les personnes susceptibles d’avoir été contaminées par une personne testée positive à la Covid-19, pendant une période donnée parce n’ayant pas
respecté la distanciation physique.
Les alertes sonores fonctionnent indépendamment de la plateforme et du moteur de recherche qui pourraient être utilisés pour
l’identification et le traçage des cas déclarés au cas où le Gouvernement en décidait. Toutes les données collectées par l’application seraient le cas échéant conservées sur un serveur du Gouvernement. En perspective, elle pourra
être utilisée pour gérer toute autre épidémie/pandémie au Bénin."

Portfolio of Experimentation on Gender Norms, Patriarchy and Masculinities 
Gender norms -which emerged from a patriarchal system of rule that is intertwined with masculine ideologies -create social injustices for people around the world. We are testing (whether?) different ways to challenge the patriarchal system, masculine ideologies, and gender norms in Jordan, to see whether they can carve out a space for new systems/ways? of pursuing gender and social justice in the development sector. After the completion of the first experiment as part of the Lab's work on gender and reflecting on the lessons learned, we looked for local initiatives already working on a similar topic. This exploration led us to a collaboration with a new type of partner for upcoming experiments on challenging gender norms -with Basmitak Hat'alem (SAIB) on the effect of spatial design on behavior related to gender norms. After conducting participatory behavioral research on three households, different situations were observed. In some cases, there was a traditional division of gender roles, reflected in the spaces that members spend time in and the chores they do. Others times, positive gender norms were observed, where both male and female family members are taking part in the chores and also spending time in different spaces in the house. The observed positive behaviors were considered potential ""solutions"" to further explore. 
Theory of Change
If spatial changes were made in houses with negative gender exclusive spaces, then these interventions will positively change the behavior family members towards more equitable gender norms/roles
FAMILY 1 Remarks & Challenges 1 Part of the house is unused (the grandmother’s space), (Consent to expand the family’s space over the grandmother’s is granted) 2 Lack of privacy for all family members has been recorded. 3 Relatively, low participation of the male members has been recorded. 4 The existed open kitchen design is not serving its purpose as it's open to a corridor with a dead end. 5 As in the chart of ""Behaviors associated with gender type"", despite the father's (male) positive participation in the house, the greatest reliance at work is on the mother (female). 6 There is no space for children's activities. 
Positive points to exploit and develop (Opportunities): The positive gendered spaces. Both the mother and the father contribute to the chores: An intervention to the space can motivate the father to handle more household responsibilities together with his wife. 
Spatial interventions 1 Combining the kitchen with the living room 2 Add a Kitchenette to grandma space. 3 4 Switch the guest room with Grandma's living room (suggested). Provide a rooftop space. 
TBD 1 2 3 Replace the roof with one of three: Sandwich panels, concrete, Combination of both). The stairs leading to the roof of the house. The location of the water tanks."

This weekend I visited the low income community located less than 2 KM from my place on the outskirts of the western part of Bogor, West Java. I came across this community which has created new initiatives since couple of months ago during the pandemic. Young people who were worried about the limited space for movement and the uncertainty of facing a pandemic, had a strong desire to carry out useful activities in their neighborhood. The inter-generational discussion showed the same anxiety experienced by the older generation who were also worried about meeting their food needs and the sustainability of their household economy. They started the initiative by asking permission from a landowner to use his plot of land as a farming location for the local community. With a limited area of ​​land, they decided to use planting media made of used goods such as plastic wrappers for cooking oil and detergent, used plastic bottles, used paint buckets, and so on. The residents are offered to grow the vegetables they wanted, especially for their own consumption. However, residents are also allowed to sell their crops to fellow neighbors. The need for planting media and compost answers the challenge of better waste management. People sort waste from households and the stream that passes through their dense settlement. As a result, in addition to obtaining planting media and compost, the river flow is clean enough for fish farming. In addition, the community also has access to clean water and an irrigation system. The caretakers of the plants are mostly men, especially those who have free time or do not work. Some women earn extra money by participating in marketing vegetables in the neighborhood. A bamboo hall has been built over the river that brings together members of the community across generations and groups. People expressed that being involved in community farming had reduced their stress, made them happy and increased their sense of community pride. Currently the community is in the process of building a greenhouse over the river. Community agility makes their social innovation more developed. 
Waste management, access to good nutrition, clean water and irrigation system, social cohesion, mental health and well being, gender equality, economic and livelihood, youth empowerment. 
Strong engagement and understanding of the context itself including the identification of challenges and availability of local resources can provide a basis for formulating a community-based circular economy. 
What works - an enabling environment for social innovation: (a) Solidarity from the owner of a small plot of land, (b) Strong community initiatives with supportive community leaders, (c) Creativity in finding solutions to various challenges, (d) Social cohesion across generations and groups.
Unmet needs: (a) Good collective financial management, (b) Cultivation of seeds, (c) Alternative strategies to
increase awareness of hygiene and sanitation, especially discipline in disposing of waste."

1- Exploring
I did not have to go too far to observe people crowding at the corner of the main street nearby my home. Day workers rushing toward cars and incomers to offer their services, which vary with respect to their skills (construction, plumbers...etc.). One factor in common they have is that every day is an absolute struggle to put food on the table for their families.
2- Interview, Information and Data collection
I approached a group of workers and asked what their main issues were and how to make their work pursuit better. The answers were several but a common one was SPEEDING UP the matching process. In fact, the matching between the customers seeking workers and the day laborers is hard to establish. This is mainly due to the information asymmetry, some workers pretending they have sets of skills they don’t in desperately attempting to match the customers offers (This leads the confidence of customers to deteriorate) ...etc.
3- Solution Mapping
I immediately considered a matching solution. How about an electronic platform or an application that acts as a labor market maker for less skilled workers (in reference to financial market makers which match bids and asks)? This will tremendously speed up the recruitment process cycles making the workers to benefit more from it.
4- Originality and Ethics
Excited about the idea, I sought to verify its originality and if anyone else came up with such a solution in advance. For doing so, I engaged in online research, social media and exploited some personal connections for that purpose. And the answer was YES! A group of young researchers came up with a very similar idea to address the problem of crowding of less-skilled workers. Their perception comprises a speeding up solution to the matching process through an application they are trying to develop.
5- Interviewing the Group of Researchers
The young researchers were interested in developing the application, however, they blame the lack of financial means to pursue their goals.
The needs answered by the solution can be listed as follow:
Clearing up or lowering the crowding in the main streets of the city.
Reducing the intensity of traffic congestion.
Benefiting workers with low income and skills (SDGs 1 and 2).
Contributing in employment formation (SDGs 8).
Reducing the risk of contracting the covid-19 among workers.
A main lesson can be learned from this observation. That is, well designed and tailored local solution can have a substantial impact on people’s livelihood. The impact of local solutions on SDGs targets can have an amplified effect through the dynamic nature of learning and solving at smaller scales. This is particularly true when it comes to jobs creation for the pool of less skilled workers, where the effect on the wellbeing of the poorest laborers can be felt considerably."

This solution was mapped thanks to the third edition of the challenge ""Innovating together for children and sustainable development"", which aimed to boost solutions that had an impact on clean and affordable energy or solid and liquid waste management. To combat the sanitation crisis and the dangerous consequences of disease transmission, health and hygiene problems, Mosan provides a complete, climate-positive sanitation solution, a human excreta collection service and its transport to Mosan Transformation centers. All solutions of the challenge had a great potential, however, MOSAN has all the characteristics of an innovative solution for sustainable development for Guatemala and many other communities that need sanitation, clean water, and health conditions. So far, this solution is already contributing to the community of Santa Catarina Palopó, providing an alternative management for human organic waste, and preventing polluted water and material be thrown at Lake Atitlan."

Karasolar
https://karasolar.com/
Kara Solar began as a partnership between the Achuar indigenous people of Ecuador and engineers, anthropologists, communicators, and other allies that was established in 2018 to build solar-powered river transport and energy networks in Achuar territory, Ecuador.
Provide clean infrastructure to support technological independence, liberating communities from the restraints of gasoline power. In the Amazon, geographical dispersion demands the use of gasoline run boats or canoes, at very high prices. Gas stations are located at long distances, require several type of transportations. Solar energy run boats, reduce the dependence on petrol and money. To access to petrol, deforestation occurs, even if it is cutting down one tree to acess to cash to buy gasoline, the impact spreads throughout the territory.
The model created in Achuar territory is applicable to rainforests across the Amazon and around the world. Now, Kara is accompanying indigenous communities in Brazil, Peru, Solomon Islands, and Suriname as they replicate this model pioneered in Achuar territory.

Farmers have for years been blamed for feeding the country on vegetables and fruits with abnormally high concentrations of herbicides and pesticides.

It is for these reasons that Stephen Njoroge has taken up rabbit farming not just for their meat but also for their highly concentrated urine.

The innovation helps to control the spread of army worms in farms. The sprayer which is strapped on the back has six adjustable nozzles capable of spraying below the leaves of the maize crop, where the destructive crop hides during the day to escape direct sunlight. This hungry caterpillar feeds on several plant species but its preferred host is maize, a crop whose acreage is expanding faster than any other cereal as the demand for ugali and animal fodder increases. The pest presents a peculiar challenge as it can consume over 200 kilometers of crop during its adult stage, laying thousands of eggs along its way. Larvae burrow inside maize whorls or hide under the leaves, where they are partially protected from pesticides. The pump's rotating nozzles, which are adjustable, are located on each side of the sprayer and can be adjusted to spray directly inside the funnel, where the worm feeds, and the outside of the crop, where it hides. The sprayer is charged by a solar powered dynamo and when the solar power runs out, it uses a manual hand pump which serves as a backup.

Such is 'smart Agriculture' by using solar energy to draw groundwater needed for irrigation of farms. This solar-powered water system has the capacity to pump water into a 10,000L tank in just under two and a half hours. Using a gravity feed piping system, water from the tank is then sent to the two fish ponds, each holding 1000 tilapia fish, and a separate tap sends water directly to the four mobile sprinklers in the centre of the farm. This system also presents an opportunity for any farmer who is prepared to diversify and venture into farming fish or small livestock for that matter, as water will be readily available all year round.

Due to COVID 19 restrictions that also impacted on mobilization, the ""ice-cream grandpas"" where facing a higher challenge, how to sell their ice-creams by walking around with their mobile carts, in the urban areas and manage to go back and forth to their homes when public transportation went off and the working hours were very limited in the country. So the social network group ""Ayúdame a Trabajar"" notice their problem and suggested to bring food to the warehouse the elderly kept the carts to help them to survive. Some of them couldn ́t commute back to their homes. A young lady, María Isabel, came to help them no only providing groceries or health prevention items, but she created a Facebook page ""Abuelitos Heladeros"" with e-commerce link where packages of ice-creams from these group of ""grandpas"", could be sell through the page to help them to keep running their discrete business. Many people who knew about them started buying them many packages and collaborating either with groceries, money donations or other useful items including medic assistance. Maria Isabel with the help of family and friends raised more funds to refurbish the warehouse and open it as a residential option for them too. The initiative has grown, and now they are helping other elder that are facing rough conditions. Probably the main success key factor is that María Isabel has published all the expenses of the funds the FBPage has raised. 
The impact elderly face as technology moves faster, they remain conducting their small businesses in the traditional way, how ever with COVID 19 no only their economic activity was in risk, mobilization was blocked and the costs to use private alternative options were high. In addition, they face more risk to get the virus as elders. The solution ""Abuelitos Heladeros"" has managed to keep the economically active and even raise funds to provide them health care, better conditions in the warehouse they share. This a way how young people may help others to build a ""digital bridge"" to help others to pass thru digitalization and social media era, and not being left behind."

Plastic Pollution Challenge: The demand for straws in Ha Long is growing strongly, following the boom of the tourism industry. Quang Ninh province received more than 14 million visitors in 2019, 14% more than 2018. Among 8 million tons of plastic end up in the ocean every year, straws comprise just 0.025 percent, but significantly impacts ocean and water fauna, leading to the deaths of millions of seabirds, hundreds of thousands of sea animals and countless fish each year. 
Innovation: Green Joy is replacing plastic straws with environmentally friendly, natural straws made of Lepironia grass, which is abundant only in the Mekong Delta of Viet Nam. The production process is eco-friendly, with 90% of the process being automated and relying on solar energy, reducing electricity and water consumption and resulting in minimal carbon emissions. They are also piloting AI technologies in the sorting process to automate the production line.
Business Model: Selling to B2B HoReCa customers domestically (D2C) and wholesaler/distributors for export to Europe, America, Japan, South Korean and APAC Revenue split: 90% wholesale, 10% retail.
Market: The market demand for grass straws is growing exponentially, as single-use plastic ones are gradually banned in Europe, the US, Asia, in 2020 -2021. In the US alone, about 500 million straws are used every single day, and according to Statista.com, Eunomia. Straw Wars, 23.5 billion plastic straws were used in Europe as of March 2018. With this, they calculate that the total addressable market for grass straws is about USD 2.5 billion, in which the Service Available Market and Serviceable Obtainable Market is around USD 1 billion and USD 50 million, respectively. This market potential is about 30 times larger than our current manufacturing capabilities, about 36 million straws per year To meet such high market demand, they plan to optimize our production by gradually automating more steps of the production process."

Plastic Pollution Challenge: Plastic Pollution Challenge Single-use plastics, are leaked into the environment every minute causing a variety of problems, such as: Choking our rivers and oceans; Killing animals both on land and in the water; Entering our food chain; Creating human health problems. Unfortunately, in many cases there are no convenient alternatives to purchasing products in plastic bottles or bags, which leads to more use of virgin plastics and leaking of plastic waste into the environment.
Innovation: Refill Đây is an innovation synthesizing two existing ideas that no one else has tried before: motorbike delivery and refill stores. In many ways, it is similar to Mailing and DVDs, which is how Netflix started. The issue with refill stores is accessibility of both location and product brand. The refill shops require customers to come to the store with their containers. This is problematic if one lives far from the store as it is easier to just go to the local convenience store. Additionally, these refill shops tend to sell 100% all-natural and expensive brands that most customers have never heard of. By delivering well-known, trusted brands to the consumers’ doorstep, Refill Đây addresses both of these problems and brings an innovative new concept to the marketplace."

5% of product sales are returned directly to the child artists who authored the paintings used. 
Tohe was established in 2006 by 3 founders: Nguyen Dinh Nguyen, Pham Thi Ngan, and Nguyen Thi Thanh Tu. 
The story of Tohe began in 2005 when a group of friends Nguyen, Ngan, and Tu began to visit the Center for Nurturing the Elderly and Disabled Children Thuy An, Ba Vi as volunteers. They organized art and painting activities for the children at the weekend; thereby understanding more about the difficult and needy life as well as the innocent spirit, love of life and simple wishes of the children. 
May 2006: The founding group came up with the idea of ​​​​founding ""Tòhe"" after visiting the Picasso museum in Barcelona and reading the famous quote of the artist: ""It took me 4 years to be able to draw like Raphael , but had to spend a lifetime drawing like a child"". Inspired by Vietnamese folk toys, we want Tohe to become a creative playground where children benefit from their own play. 
September 29, 2006: Tohe Joint Stock Company was officially established and has legal status. 
September 2009: Tohe was recognized as a Social Enterprise and received support from the CSIP Community Service Initiative Support Center and the British Council Vietnam.

ASOCIACIÓN DE PRODUCCIÓN, INDUSTRIALIZACIÓN, Y COMERCIALIZACIÓN DE BIENES Y SERVICIOS AGROFORESTALES, PECUARIOS, ARTESANALES, TURISMO ""ASOBIENTUR"",
La asociación, que se encuentra ubicada en la región de la Amazonía ecuatoriana, ofrece 4 emprendimientos en las áreas de turismo comunitario, elaboración de jabón artesanal, aprovechamiento de madera a través de un taller de carpintería y un vivero forestal. 
Sin embargo, debido a la emergencia sanitaria por la COVID19, la asociación se centró en la elaboración de jabón artesanal con la ayuda del PNUD. Anteriormente los emprendimientos estaban a cargo de la comunidad, pero por temas de política de cada gobierno se conformó una asociación para el manejo de todos los emprendimientos. 
Su principal diferencia se evidencia en la asociación comunitaria, donde todos los ingresos recaudados por la elaboración y venta del jabón artesanal son compartidos con todos sus socios y socias de forma equitativa. Dentro de las buenas prácticas se encuentra el trabajo en conjunto con socio bosque y PNUD en el tema de la elaboración de jabón. Esta idea inició hace 7 años a través de capacitaciones y ayuda con recursos e insumos por parte de un voluntariado. 
El principal impacto de este emprendimiento es el trabajo que se realiza con los jóvenes para que formen parte del proyecto y mantengan su operación en el futuro. Además, busca tener un impacto positivo en la comunidad al generar ingresos y medios de vida de manera sustentable.

Totya Platform supports victims of sexual abuse overcome trauma and get justice. The Social Problem
In Uganda 78% of the primary school children and 82% of the secondary school students report having experienced sexual abuse at school (UNICEF 2013). According to the Annual Crime Report (2013) of the Uganda Police Force, close to 10,000 cases of defilement were reported in 2013, making it the second leading crime committed in Uganda. Astoundingly, only four percent of perpetrators have been convicted. The number of unreported cases are unknown but are estimated to be as high as even 50,000 per year. Tens of thousands of girls suffer in silence, while the perpetrators are not prosecuted. Like in my own case, it often happens within family settings and this is what makes it so difficult and often impossible for the victims to talk about. They do not want to be responsible for breaking the family apart or they fear the consequences of e.g. not receiving school fees or basic needs. The fear that no one will believe often leaves the victim to blame herself, even hate herself sometimes for the rest of their live or committing suicide. Without being able to speak about the events, girls end up being affected for life about the way they perceive themselves, relationships with men and lack of self-belief. Janet Aguti was one of the girls sexually abused as a child. For 17 years she did not find the courage to tell anyone. She started to see her past as strength rather than a subject of shame and Today, Janet Aguti is the founder and driving force of Totya Platform!
The Solution
Totya Platform provides support to victims of sexual violence through Peer Groups, Life-Coaching- in person and online, as well as medical and legal support of severe cases. Anonymous interactions with survivors of sexual violence, who overcame sexual abuse themselves, enable users to speak about their experiences while receiving emotional care and self-help tools. Our service is free and available to those who were victims of sexual violence – no matter what type or by whom – in their childhood or as youths. Totya supports all questions and problems that have resulted from the sexual violence and its effects as an adult. Coaching sessions are absolutely confidential.
If you would wish to talk to Totya Platform, send a message (also WhatsApp) to (+256) (0)759 296 003 (internationally) or call the Free End Sexual Abuse Hotline: 080 0220630 (Uganda only. People who have successfully transformed the experiences are encouraged to find strength in speaking up, joining our campaigns online campaigns to break the taboo on speaking about sexual abuse. For continuous self-organized support among each other, self-help groups are initiated for the women, meeting regularly and in person"

Bio sand water filters
Our focus is on eliminating Water borne diseases by providing plenty of safe water to both institutions
and households in a way that preserves our environment. In a country where keeping drinking water clean or even getting clean water in the first place is difficult, there are few communities that don’t face preventable illnesses like typhoid that come from these sources of water. Even pipes are not always safe. Traditionally, people then try and boil their water, which consumes a lot of charcoal and time. Then, the water is stored in pots and jerrycans, and if it wasn’t contamined during transport, bacteria will now easily enter.
This is a lot of effort for a small outcome. Tusafishe has inquired from the communities that there is a need for a better solution, and our solution is a simple one: Sand filters. Using the same principle as natural springs in the ground, it is simply a bucket filled with nothing but freshly ground granite. It filters particles, bacteria, even chemicals out of the water and makes it safe to drink. One small bucket filters up to 40 liters per day, enough for an average household. A large bucket has a capacity of 200 liters per day. And the more the filter is used, the more the material compacts – the water will get even cleaner over time. It’s „forever lasting“: The Tusafishe granite just needs to be washed and dried every few months and the bucket can be refilled right away."

The only organization that is authorized to issue such certificates is the Ukrainian Chamber of Commerce, so we reached out to them and asked whether they are able to meet the growing demand and issue enough certificates.

Address climate change, livestock feed, reforestation, and land restoration
Organization behind

Agave plants and nitrogen-fixing trees can reduce and isolate considerable amounts of CO2. They also produce more biomass above and below ground on a continuous basis than any other desert or semi-desert species.It is estimated that this system can absorb and store the dry weight equivalent of 30-50 tons of CO2/ha/year both above and below ground.
Currently the use of agave for land restoration is promoted by the Billion Agaves Project, which is an ecosystem regeneration strategy adopted by innovative Mexican farms located in the high desert region of Guanajuato.
This strategy combines the growth of agave plants and nitrogen-fixing companion forest species (such as mesquite), with rotational grazing of cattle. The result is a high biomass, high forage production system that works well even on degraded semi-arid lands.
The system produces large quantities of agave leaves and pineapples, up to a ton of biomass during the 8 to 10 years of the plant's life. When chopped and fermented in closed containers, the agave leaf makes excellent animal fodder and is cheap (2 cents a pound). This agroforestry system reduces overgrazing pressure on fragile pastures and improves soil health and water retention while reducing and storing enormous amounts of atmospheric CO2.
The goal of the Billion Agaves campaign is to plant one billion agaves around the world to reduce and store billions of tons of CO2 that destabilize the climate. The campaign will be sponsored by donations and public and private investments.

Food entrepreneurs
A. It utilizes the Cauldron, other than being a cooking ware to its optimum use by draining the water after cooking the suman, and displaying them in the store while kept inside it. The lid or cover is only opened once customers purchase the product. This is a deviation from the usual where the suman is displayed openly in stand and trays. The traditional way provides an open for the warmth of the suman to diffuse in the air.
.
B. It keeps the suman as though it's freshly cooked; hence providing greater consumer satisfaction.
C. It's also a very wise sanitary practice to keep them inside the cauldron since bacteria carried by flies and other insects, as well other microorganisms in the air cannot easily contaminate the suman, unlike when it is left in the open.

Opaw Ice 4 Sale shares their techniques in keeping their blocks of Ice frozen even 2 more days than usual time it stays in solid state inside their Storage Facility.
He said that the secret lies in their piling of the ice. Unlike the practice in the Ice plants and other Storage Facilities, the block are piled vertically upright position, they do it in a horizontal position. Moreover, they pile the blocks side by side, eliminating the space in between them. This prevents air to get in between which speeds up the melting of ice. Considering that the facility is purely constructed from concrete, they cover the ice with layers of plastic bags which also aid in slowing the melting of ice.
This makes Opaw Ice 4 Sale one standout in innovation.
The need to extend shelf / storage life of ice blocks.
For ice retailers who are looking to extend ice blocks shelf life.
A. The staff of this ice storage facility are unconscious that they have been applying principles of thermodynamics. This is evidence by their unique way of piling ht e blocks of ice inside the storage room. Unlike the usual practice where the blocks are positioned vertically upright- they pile the ice horizontally. This is done to keep the ice from getting too much exposure from the heat on the room's ceiling. Since the facility is made up of full concrete, the walls and ceilings absorb the sun's energy , hence the nearer the ice is to the ceiling the faster it melts.
B. The usual practice of piling them often creates gaps and spaces in between the blocks. With their innovation, they pile the ice side by side, closely to each other, thereby eliminating the spaces. This keeps air from getting out in between the spaces which speeds up the melting process.
C. Since the facility is made up of full concrete, heat is absorbed and the inside is basically, warm, hot or humid. So, to delay the melting process of ice, they cover the pile with layers of thick plastic bags so as to reduce the penetration of heat. This also more sanitary than the use of rice hulls which was an old practice of delaying the melting of ice.

University of Basrah in Iraq took an extraordinary place in responding to COVID19 and in supporting the Iraqi government to tackle this pandemic through their local activities. One of these activities is manufacturing local Ventilator Devices inside the university with international standards and in cooperation with the university academics and local private sector. These devices got the official approval of Basrah Health Directorate and asked the university to provide them with 10 ventilator devices and here where the UNDP is looking forward in supporting the Academic Sector in achieving the required objective through providing the raw materials.

Because of the pandemic, the demand of ventilator devices has increased and here where the Ministry of Industry and Minerals took the initiative to respond through manufacturing Ventilator’s Adapters and 3D Face Shields. The Adaptors are for the purpose of connecting more than one patient on one ventilator device inside the hospitals, and it is one of the quick solutions that are used in the absence of access to the ventilators. The process of making these adaptors was done through using the 3D printers with specific features. These connections are an effective solution to reduce the load on the available ventilation devices. For example, 10 ventilator devices can cover 20 patients with these adapters. The adapters got the approval from the Ministry of Health – Nineveh Health Directorate and asked to provide them with these adapters. The same for the Face shields that made from 3D printers with international standards.

The Iraqi Innovation Alliance is a cross-border, semi-formalized alliance that merges innovation hubs all over Iraq in one national network. It currently has 8 members: The Station, Recoded, FikraSpace, KAPITA, Five One Labs, Mosul Space, Science Camp & Field Ready, with a rotated coordinator every 3 months who is responsible for coordinating the activities of the alliance. The alliance was born out of an organic Iraqi movement with the support of GIZ.
The purpose of IIA is to increase the visibility of ICT entrepreneurship and employment in Iraq, to widen the entrepreneurs’ network and foster mutual capacity building. The alliance seeks to reach untapped areas in Iraq that have lacked access to opportunities and to provide support to young Iraqi job-seekers, especially between the ages of 15 to 35, investors, entrepreneurs and private sector companies. Lastly, it should eventually represent the needs and interests of the ecosystem on a government level, i.e., lobbying for policies that create a business-friendly environment for entrepreneurs.

When buying eggs in bulk (36 pieces), there is no separate box to keep the eggs from breaking. They only come in one tray which is difficult and dangerous to carry. The solution that sales people created is the DIY box made of two pieces of tray with the tape around them to be used as a handle. 
The solution answers the need to have a box for 36 eggs in one go that is safe to transport 
This solution shows how individual entrepreneurs and especially vendors come up with ideas that make it easier to sell their products. For examples, unless the vendor had this DIY box, I would not have bought as many eggs - I would have gotten only 10 eggs that come in the box and are more expensive. 
Because the vendor has done this process of making the box many times, she was quick and efficient in putting it together with the handle - fascinating process that would have taken me longer to implement :)"

It was interesting that the trading place is installed on the artificial bank which is supported by used tires.

On the pantry, there is also a sign saying 'Please take anything you need, and leave anything you can share'. 
In addition, a map compiling sharing pantries nationwide has been developed so that the community can record where the food pantries are across the nation.

- Offer alternative means of donations for those who want to donate but do not know where to drop off donations

Specialists from the Department of Biotechnology of the Iztapalapa Unit of the Autonomous Metropolitan University (UAM) designed a biorefinery for the sustainable management of water lilies in the Xochimilco canals in the south of Mexico City. 
The installation can be adapted to different topographies, replicated, and scaled in other sites, according to parameters of environmentally friendly technology, social justice, and economic viability.

Dr. Ernesto Favela Torres –responsible for the project– has been working for over 40 years in research to use the plant as an absorbent for water purification in rivers and canals.
The purpose is to create biotechnologies to amortize the costs of subtraction and handling, tasks that, depending on the body of water, reach up to 600,000 MXN per hectare.
As part of a first phase, they managed to develop bioprocesses for the production of bioethanol, enzymes, compost, biogas and prebiotics, the latter with a patent involved, he stressed."

In addition, recycling in Latin America is not so easy because there is no comprehensive waste management system.
For this reason they took on the task of creating a database of the centers, which took them two years, because the compilation was done by hand and from door to door.

Plastic Bottle Constructions of houses as a means of Upcycling
Winner of the 2020 UN-Habitat Scroll of Honour award, Upcycle Africa upcycles plastic bottles by building houses.
There are over 150 Million Tonnes of Plastic already in the oceans. Every year, eight million tonnes of plastic waste end up in oceans and lakes. Experts predict that there will be more plastic than fish in oceans by 2050. And yet, the more waste we generate, the more waste we need to dispose off, but how? Plastic waste is not the only challenge we have in Uganda and Africa as a whole. Housing is still very expensive especially for people living in slums and low income areas. In Kampala, homes in slums are usually filled up with water when it rains, damaging property and making it difficult for people to live decently and yet, dignified housing is expensive considering that these families earn an average of $40 as monthly income.
Upcycle Africa protects the environment and promotes innovative mind-set while empowering youth. Through up-cycling plastic waste we train our local communities in Uganda especially the disadvantaged youth to protect the environment. Bottles replace environmentally unfriendly bricks, which are burnt for days promoting deforestation. Plastic bottles are collected and compacted with soil, making the houses very cost effective and affordable. Furthermore, the buildings are durable, buffer heat and are earthquake resistant. Upcycle Africa has constructed houses in different parts of Africa while creating employment opportunities for rural women and youths this has ensured economic empowerment for these women. These cash incentive allows low-income families to support their children with school fees. We also have a waste recovery system where we collect plastic waste from beaches, streets and bus stations ensuring clean and safe environments."

In this context, the Bangladesh Accelerator Lab through its study on ‘Exploring Student Perspective on Micro-credentials’ is conducting a university level student survey to understand current use, and the level of interest in micro-credentials, validate specific micro-credential courses which are important specially to succeed in Bangladesh’s growing BPO and IT sector.

Jangu Tusome is a local Ugandan community based organization born in SINA and a partner to Jangu e.V. in Germany for educational sponsorships of orphans in Uganda throughout high school.
If you are interested in sponsoring a child through Jangu Tusome, please find more details here.
Since 2014, many of the former sponsored students started to engage in the work of Jangu e.V. to support their younger brothers and sister of the Kankobe Children’s Home. Being sponsored as a child, they now sponsor others and create an outstanding, sustainable cycle to tackle the social problems of Uganda. Nowadays, Jangu e.V. doesn’t only provide sponsorships and life guidance to orphans from Kankobe but includes many other project. Thus, in 2016 former sponsored students founded “Jangu Tusome” which stands for the coordination of the sponsorship program in Uganda. Together they take on essential roles like paying our partner schools, handing out scholastic materials and supporting the sponsored students in every day life. The fact, that the children of the Kankobe Children’s Home receive a proper education and are able to grow to mature and independent humans is in many ways owed to the work of the “Jangu Tusome” Team."

Here is how it usually goes. Every person, predominantly a group of woman, makes a monthly contribution. For instance, for a group of 10 women where every woman gives 500 MAD. the group assign the total, in this case 5000 MAD to one of them because of her pressing needs at the time. and the others will have each a turn and everyone keep systematically contributing the same amount. Where things are interesting is while every one have some skin in the game, the money allocating decision making is consensual and works just fine proving how trust can be enough to oil the informal finance machine."

It can be very challenging for low-income households to access to financing through traditional sources. This can be related to a low level of financial soundness, and their mostly precarious and/or temporary access to the labor market means that they are mostly in the informal sector of the economy. In this situation, people turn to communal banks as a source of extraordinary capital, which they could not have been able to attain on their own. Communal banking is a method based on microcredits. According to this method, a civil society organization brings together a group of people—usually women from low-income neighborhoods, who know each other and get together by bonds of trust—to manage the delivery of credit, saving strategies, and mutual support. Following this logic, communal banks are spaces anchored in people’s social capital, where credit is granted to reliable individuals, introduced by bank members who also act as guarantors. Borrowers who are not active members of the space pay a higher interest rate. In order to build a group of partners, the organizations that lend the money usually look for referents in the field. The group members establish a meeting point, draw up a set of rules of coexistence, and meet regularly. These women typically adopt different rotating roles. Apart from this, we observed throughout our fieldwork that the communal banks (called banquitos—little banks—in the territory) usually have a will to expand. Communal banks are also a space for the acquisition/socialization of financial planning learning that is then transferred to the household economy. Although this is not the initial purpose of a communal bank, its members—by managing it—go through a learning process that allows them to recognize their spending structure and try to optimize it. The process of supporting business ventures development in practice allows them to observe how others solve problems or apply their knowledge. The lessons are not purely on a theoretical level (accounting, financial, etc.). These experiences can help people recognize, for example, the importance of each expense (including, for instance, the pinch of salt used to prepare a meal to be sold) when setting the prices of the products or services to be sold. During the field work conducted for our mapping “Close up: Financial Inclusion and Grassroots Solutions”, we observed a communal bank operation and, afterwards, asked some of its members what the most important lesson learned had been. Instead of focusing on their income, people talked about their expenses and told us that the real change had begun by identifying how they had been spending their money: “Thanks to the banquito, I learned how to manage at home. For example, I take a blank piece of paper and write down my expenses; thus, at the end of the month, I know how much money I paid for cable, telephone, and gas services”.– Woman, member of the communal bank in José León Suárez “With this (the communal bank), I learned to reduce expenses. Telephones... I ask myself: Why do I buy three if I need one?” – Woman, member of the communal bank in José León Suárez The interviewees agreed that this experience helped them stop buying items they did not use (for example, some products that got spoiled because they were not consumed), avoid the temptation of discounts, stop asking for loans to pay debts, among other adjustments. After identifying how money was spent in their homes and making small changes in their household economies, the members of the communal bank claimed that they could put aside some money to save, plan and achieve goals that, before, they thought were out of their reach. These testimonies reflected a process that made them proud, and through which they were improving their control over their finances. They also showed how behavioral change occurred as a group, as learning was shared among their colleagues. While financial education is not an end in itself, it is a means for individuals to better manage household finances, develop a business venture, or achieve an otherwise distant goal. To do this, closeness and trust are fundamental elements, and in that establishing a shared space where inhibition barriers—not knowing something, having doubts, or making mistakes—are reduced. Finally, learning by doing is associated with behavioral changes (good habits, use of better tools, etc.), and can be very rewarding for people.

775,164,"['training', 'youth', 'digital tools', 'digital services']",['trainings'],"Financial Inclusion and Digital Transition: Training for the Digital Transition
The digital transition accelerated by the pandemic introduce an extended use of digital payments, transactions, and procedures. When faced with this, many people from low-income neighborhoods, especially the elderly, struggled and turn to their families, friends, and community to learn how to navigate these new mechanisms. Young people tend to feel more confident than adults when using cell phones, at least in handling certain basic experiences. Hence, many of them develop extended and informal practices of intergenerational digital education. For example, these trainings can be useful for adopting new features and/or payment platforms (for example, to pay for transportation), banks or digital wallets, among others. This symbolizes a real financial inclusion, given the extended use of these mechanisms nowadays. Young people regularly prove to be more open to adopting and sharing technology. On the other hand, adults may be curious about it for reasons associated with economic convenience, practicality, etc., or they may eventually consider the need to start using it. In addition to the interest or curiosity detected, the fear of falling into debt mechanisms in digital platforms is also recognized. Several testimonies collected in the mapping “Close up: Financial Inclusion and Grassroots Solutions” refer to experiences of older adults in this regard. Because of this, this informal training: i) is first limited to family members or close acquaintances; and ii) promotes confidence in the use of the cell phone and in the digital platforms to be adopted. This trust is associated with the person (a young acquaintance) who has already been operating in the virtual world and identifies actual benefits (better price, good service, or others). Furthermore, the women interviewed for “Mujeres en Red” (Women in Network) made it clear that the decision to install this type of application is often done simultaneously with the process of learning how to use it, usually with help from family members and/or close people who accompanied the process and act as trainers. However, there was evidence of a lack of institutional communicators/trainers in a formalized and systematic way. Such is their importance that it is impossible to use technology in the absence of a self-teaching predisposition or a person close to them who can guide its use , and the barriers that are in place cannot be overcome. Finally, it is important to remember that widespread access to cell phones does not imply a high level of confidence in their use, nor overcoming the problems associated with data use at the base of the pyramid. Additionally, to facilitate these trainings and encourage the use of these new mechanisms, the lack of internet connectivity is a real problem in low-income neighborhoods. To face this problem, social organizations that already offered training also pay for Wi-Fi to attract and retain young people, so that they do not spend their time on the street. There, they share their time with people of different ages with whom they could share their knowledge.

Co-created project: Citizens participate in all stages of the scientific process. 
Overall goal: Analyze the environmental dynamics of coasts in the province of Buenos Aires - Create a solid database that is sustained over time in which local stakeholders participate and play a major role in different complex issues, such as erosion, sedimentation, storm effects, and landscape changes. Specific goals: Implement an environmental data monitoring system that is continuous and sustained over time throughout the coast of the province of Buenos Aires - Analyze the impact of extreme weather events, its year-over-year and seasonal variation and tendency on beaches of the province of Buenos Aires - Based on citizen participation, create a database of socio-environmental dynamics in each study town - Establish coastal erosion risk levels due to natural and anthropic actions - Strengthen the links among research institutions, civil society organizations, and decision-makers. 
Description of citizen participation: Citizen participation starts by defining the coastal area to be measured based on the social or environmental issues citizens note or perceive on their own. After the area is defined, participants collect data every month (type of breaker, wave height and period, longshore drift speed and direction, sediment size, and beach profile) using measurement techniques learned in previous training sessions. Finally, the collected data is sent digitally to the project’s email. After a storm, data is also sent with photos and/or videos and pre-designed forms completed with citizens’ perceptions of the storm’s effects on their towns. In June 2024, the project plans to organize participatory workshops in which citizens will be encouraged to think about possible solutions for the perceived issues and whether it is attainable to carry out some of them, for example, the decision and implementation of garbage bins.

Local market disruptions caused by the COVID-19 crisis mitigated through promoting the accessibility of SkyEye’s E-Commerce solution for both vendors and customers, and to address language barriers for rural and marginalised segments. The project is a joint initiative by UNCDF PFIP and UNDP, and aims to mitigate local market disruptions caused by the Covid-19 crisis by supporting SkyEye to scale its existing E-Commerce solution, Maua App. This will be achieved by strengthening SkyEye’s operational capacity, focusing on vendor onboarding and improving Maua App’s accessibility and usage by marginalised segments such as women, rural communities and people with disabilities (PWDs).
The MAUA app was first developed to counter the lack of online shopping services during the lockdowns in Samoa from the Measles outbreak in 2019. The Covid-19 pandemic accelerated its scalability to be more inclusive of the marginalized and vulnerable informal sector.

RESIN8 represents a near and long-term environmentally friendly solution where the plastic industry waste stream becomes the raw material and value stream for the construction and building industry. This technological solution represents circularity in action, where the concrete is eventually recycled at the end of its useful life. RESIN8 accepts any type of plastic waste (Resins 1-7), diverting it away from landfills or incineration. Plastic waste materials are converted into RESIN8, a visually benign lightweight Eco-Aggregate, which meets the needs of the construction industry while also extending the productive use of plastic waste. The unique thermal properties of RESIN8 make it an effective building insulation product, which contributes to the reduction of building energy use, and thus improves climate resiliency, and supports net-zero goals over time through accumulated energy savings. There is no leaching, abrasion, or micro-plastic release after utilization in concrete. As a recycled product, RESIN8, is fully circular at the end of its concrete life. It can be crushed and re-used and has a low embodied energy production footprint.
RESIN8 is the only material from plastic waste to improve the performance of structural concrete products and earn acceptance from the construction industry. Concrete applications using RESIN8 exceed ASTM standards which are the international benchmark for material performance. RESIN8 has been tested to demonstrate an increase in compression strength, flexibility, fire resistance, thermal resistance and acoustic properties. It can be used in structural* or non-structural* concrete applications, and “poured in place” concrete.
This solution is quite relevant for Samoa and is being implemented under the CERO waste project. In Samoa, with landfills at its full capacity, plastic is already leaking in the ocean. Also, sand mining for construction is another environmental concern. This solution not only provides a viable option for recycling plastic, it is also providing alternative for reducing sand use in construction.

Most households in peri urban and rural areas are not connected to the main sewerage lines that facilitate efficient and adequate waste disposal. This has led to some households relying on the use of pit latrines as a means of human waste (faecal matter) disposal. These pit latrines are buried when full and another site located for a new one. The pollution, health concerns and environmental degradation of this activity leaves much to be desired.
The innovator has produced a non-toxic instant pit latrine dissolvent powder (Disolpit) which reduces the volume of human waste in pit latrines. The powder can be used both in pit latrines and septic tanks. With this reduction in volume, the number of pit latrines dug in peri-urban and rural areas would be reduced as the same one can still be used for a longer periods. The powder also helps to reduce bad smells associated with pit latrines as it rapidly digests waste assuring easy pump-outs. It attacks and neutralizes fly larvae, kills bacteria and maggots; and is non hazardous to people, animals and water bodies."

Genesis of the innovation The innovator lives in a cold region where warm water is required for daily use. His family had a conventional hamam, or water-heater, which used wood as fuel. Watching smoke escape from the burning wood made him aware of heat wastage. His innovation came out of his experiments on the hamam to use this heat efficiently. He named the innovation after his son Raman Deep as Ramandeep Eco Hamam. The phrase “Eco” is used as the device is fuel efficient and produced less smoke. Conventional hamams get damaged very soon and a lot of energy gets wasted as well. Every year or two, either a new one has to be purchased or the top portion needs to be replaced. To address this problem, he modified the hamam by removing the top portion and using aluminum sheet instead of iron sheet. One day when hamam was being used, he forgot to remove a four litre water container he kept on its top. After half an hour while draining out hot water, he realised that he had got additional four litres of hot water without extra effort or cost. This triggered him to utilize the heat otherwise going waste. In his attempt, he removed the aluminum cover and placed a ten litre container of water directly on the top of hamam. But instead of heating the water, the fire got extinguished as the air flow got blocked. The hamam had to be lit again. A metal ring was kept on the hamam and sides were punched to ensure better air flow. But for refueling, still, the container on the top had to be removed, which was cumbersome. A window was then cut for refueling but that led to the escape of flames to the outside and loss of heat. Then instead of the window, a door was used, but then complete combustion was not taking place and a lot of smoke was being generated. He kept on addressing one issue after the other and modifying the hamam till he was satisfied with the output. The Raman Deep Eco Hamam (Water heater) The modified hamam consists of a conventional hamam and two heat exchangers. Water is filled in the tank through the inlet and wood is ignited. Similar to the conventional hamam, water is directly heated in the lower most chambers. The heat exchangers channelise heat generated through smoke and flames to further heat the water. Valves are present to allow water to pass from one chamber to another. When the water in the lower most chamber attains a temperature close to 100 degrees Celsius, it can be drained out separately. On being emptied, the lower chamber can be refilled with water from other chambers. As this water is preheated, it takes less time and fuel to reach 100 degrees Celsius. Alternatively, once water in the lower chamber reaches 100 degrees Celsius, it can be mixed so the overall temperature becomes around 55 degrees Celsius. The water from other chambers can also be separately drained out through separate outlets. Better fuel utilization reduces the money and/or labour involved in obtaining fuel wood. The hamam has been tested at CTAE, Udaipurm which has found its thermal efficiency to be 58% against 38.5% of conventional hamam. The CO/CO2 ratio was found 0.035 in modified hamam and 0.038 in conventional hamam which are within the safe limits. The concept of utilizing heat of smoke by using heat exchangers in the path of smoke or flumes is known in art (US Patent 4377200, 4397297, 4628869, 4137965, etc) however, the same is not available for domestic stoves. Accordingly, NIF filed a patent in the innovator’s name (1743/DEL/2011). He is awaiting the grant of the patent to start commercialization of the hamam. He takes time out from his photo studio to organize flower shows in town, particularly for school children and teachers. His technique of growing begonias on bricks has been tested and proved successful by ‘The Royal Horticulture Society’, UK, which also published his work in their publication Garden in 2000. He is a life time member of the society and was invited for the Chelsea flower show held at London during 23-26 May 2000. Also he was invited for the London Flower Show organized during June 20-21, 2000. In 2004, he also received National Integration Award for Environment Protection. He has also been interacting with schools, voluntary organizations, and government officials and sharing his work.

The wind operated power generator has two main mechanisms: the flexible stator-rotor system, which delivers power as per varying wind speeds and the governor system. These features of this generator have made it capable of delivering constant output and the capacity to work on low cutting speed, as against other similar devices1 .The AC power generator runs on the principle of mutual inductance. Any prime mover, such as wind power or hydraulic turbine or any source, from which rotary motion is available, can drive it.The highlight of this innovation is the ability to use centrifugal force, generated in the main power shaft with the use of governor, to vary the gap between stator and rotor elements. This allows very low cutting (wind) speeds to start the generator by increasing the air gap at start up. The governor facilitates reduction of this gap at higher speeds. Since the generator output is available from the stator, which is fixed, this does not require brush or slip ring.The shaft rotates and the centrifugal action helps in varying the gap between stator and rotor elements. When the rotor shaft gains momentum and the speed is increased, the centrifugal weights of the governor fly outwards actuating two levers and bring both the pairs of stator and rotor together with minimum air gap.Using commonly available materials, the innovator has built first functional prototype for Rs 7000 and more work is underway to test and standardize the product.Nirma Institute of Technology, Ahmedabad has also tested this machine. It has been submitted by NIF and GIAN West to TePP as a project proposal for funding and development.This product once fully developed will aid introduction of wind operated energy devices in areas with low wind speeds and will provide a green sustainable energy generation solution. Considering the compact size of the generator and wind blades, it could be fitted on terraces and building in urban areas as well as fields in rural regions.The patent has been filed in USA with the pro bono help of KLNG through SRISTI. 1 Following patents have been found to have some commonality with this innovation of windmill operated variable speed generator, viz. variable speed wind power system with improved energy capture via multi-level conversion. (Patent No. US452570) and variable speed wind turbine with reduced fluctuation and a static VAR mode of operation. (Patent No. US799416). In both the cases the mechanism used to control the output of the generator is totally different from that in the present innovation. Similarly, patent US6900998 describes a variable speed power system with improved energy capture via multilevel conversion, which includes a matrix converter using full-bridge, multilevel switch cells, in which semiconductor devices are clamped to a known constant DC voltage of a capacitor. Another system, which is described in http://www.automation.siemens.com/ld/windkraft/ is based on dual-feed slip ring generators, which is widely used.

The group is supported mainly on the confidence and interpersonal relationships that members have. The participatory guarantee system (PGS) recognizes that it is costly to obtain organic certification from Europe and America, so members of the farming community in Brasso Seco are carefully monitoring and documenting their own progress and information as they move towards organic best-practice, with the hope of eventually having their own homegrown label.

Zero Head Hydro Turbine by Nripen Kalita 
Kamrup, Assam
This idea first occurred to him 11 years ago when he tried to bring electricity to his own house. He worked on the basis that the conventional turbines have just 50% efficiency because of the uselessness of the upper blades, which have no mechanical output as it is a half-immersion version. Therefore he tried a full immersion turbine in which the blades were of half the area. But the mechanical output was found to be approximate twice the first version. Then he utilized this turbine in his generator cum pump driven by the river Kulashi with full submersion. At first, he made the turbine with a bamboo frame and later he strengthened it with an iron one. He also increased the number of blades from eight to twelve. Kalita acknowledges that at first, his family was not very interested in the idea, but later on, encouraged him. He is proud to note that his neighbors also benefited from his innovation. He confides that making this turbine successfully has been a satisfying experience. Furthermore, the connection with his innovative side has motivated him to pursue further ideas and he mentions that he is considering the development of an energy-related device. Remembering with gratitude the assistance offered by Mr. Diganta Kalita - who introduced him to GIAN- NE - he calls him his best friend in his journey of innovation. Kalita has designed two variants of turbine and pump models. Initially, he had developed a water turbine using bamboo for harnessing the flow energy from the river to pump water to his land way back in 1998-99. And later with assistance from GIAN-NE, a voluntary organization working in the field of development of grass-root innovations, he developed another version of the same turbine. First model The first model had a spiral offset arrangement of blades. In this, the blade axis is perpendicular to the flow direction. The offset arrangement of blades provides constant thrust to the system. In conventional water wheels, thrust is available only once when the blade is perpendicular to the flow direction. In the present arrangement, it is similar to the multi-cylinder crank arrangement in which the turbine will get thrust constantly from blades. The offset arrangement also provides sufficient clearance between blades so that floating debris will not clog the blades. Since the path of the water takes a spiral shape from the entrance to the exit, the arrangement of blades acts as a screw conveyor. This facilitates the debris to pass on from the entrance to the exit, which facilitates the smooth running of the turbine. The arrangement of the baffle-operated pump, which acts as a submersible pump facilitates the lifting of water. The cost of the complete system is only about Rs.3, 000 including labor costs which are quite affordable by small farmers. Second model The second one is an improved model in comparison with his first innovation. In this, blades are arranged spirally and the axis of the turbine is parallel to the flow direction. This arrangement is superior in construction and operation. The spiral twist of the blades in addition to tapping energy from the water provides vortex motion to the water at the exit. This feature is found to be novel as the kinetic energy of the water absorbed by the blades is regained by water due to vortex motion. (By creating a vortex in the direction of the flow, resistance will decrease i.e. water velocity will increase). In most of the existing turbines, turbulence created by the wheel rotation affects the velocity considerably. This parameter is of importance when considering the performance of downstream turbines. Working principle The turbine is completely submerged below the flow of water (river). The linear kinetic energy of the water is used for giving rotation movement to the turbine. The water passing through the turbine forces the turbine to rotate at low speed but with high torque. When the linear kinetic velocity of the water is two-meter per minute the turbine starts to rotate with a speed of 20 r.p.m. A compound gear mechanism is used to convert the rotational speed of the turbine (20 r.p.m) to a considerable requirement. An armature coil (generator) is used to extract electrical energy. A submersible pump is also coupled to the turbine set for irrigation purposes. The rotational speed of the turbine is given with the help of the driven gear and a flat belt. The turbine is made up of steel foils with a rim where the blades are welded. A-frame is made to hold the turbine in running condition when the turbine is submerged in the water. A compound gear mechanism is used to increase the speed of the armature coil shaft. The generating set (turbine) consists of the following parts namely twelve turbine Blades (flat type), a supporting frame/ trust, a drive gear with 10 teeth and a driven gear with 140 teeth, a Pulley, a Connecting belt (Flat type), an Armature coil and a Chain belt. The blades are welded in a four feet circular rim at an angle of 35°. The upper parts of the 12 blades are fixed in the circular rim that is four inches in width and the lower part of the turbine is fixed in an axle. A chain is fitted to the turbine axle and the drive gear. A lever mechanism is used to control the generation of the power by disengaging the driven gear where the shaft is coupled. A pump with a guide blade is used for irrigation. The driven gear with the help of a flat belt gives the required rotation of the pump for pumping water. Advantages The novelty lies in its portability and the fact that there is no need for a dam. Economically it is a better bet as construction and installation cost is minimal at Rs.8000, as compared to hydroelectric, steam, or any other power plant where even a micro hydel generator costs at least Rs.40,000. The maintenance cost is also quite low compared to the conventional hydroelectric power plant. Its efficiency is greater than 50%. It can be set up anywhere be it plains or mountains. And of the greatest importance is the fact that the turbine has a very high potential in rural areas where electric power supply is not available. NIF has filed a patent for the zero head water turbine."

The use of windmills is one of the oldest methods of harnessing energy from wind to pump water. However, the majority of the windmills available in the market are Aerodynamic windmills. These types of windmills require a high cut-in speed (the minimum wind speed requires for starting is about 5 to 7 km/hr) and this is a major limitation for the majority of the Indian geographical area except the coastal area. They also require high maintenance and are very expensive. This windmill has a unique design. It is working on aerodynamic principles but it is a Drag Type of low-height windmill for lifting groundwater. It starts at a very low wind speed (i.e. about 8 to 10 km/ hr), is very easy to use and maintain, and is cheap compared to the conventional windmill."

OVERVIEW
The concept of a green economy is on the rise in Iraq. The UNDP Iraq Accelerator Lab supports this move through sensing, exploring and mapping innovative local solutions to facilitate the shift of Iraq’s economy toward sustainability. One of these local solutions is the design and production of creative Eco-Bags by vulnerable women. These items feature authentic Iraqi designs with a mix of traditional and modern motifs to spread Mesopotamian culture to the world. They also encourage the public to preserve the environment, participate in societal good, and support the Iraq plan towards a green economy, thus initiating positive behavioral change toward the consumption of environmentally friendly products."

Details of Surprise Soap: 
Surprise Soaps are small, clear soaps for children with a plastic toy visible inside. The more children wash their hands, the quicker they're rewarded with the toy. By washing their hands more often, children who use the soaps are helping to make their communities healthier. The soap are locally produced with environment friendly materials (sometimes from recycled materials). The toy that is put inside the soap are made using 3D printing technology, so far Field Ready has distributed thousands of surprise soap either to children inside camp or schools. We know that kids keep their hands cleaner with Surprise Soaps, and their use eliminates the need for labor-intensive hygiene promotion. How do we know? In a 2019 research project with our partners Save the Children and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, we tested children's use of the Surprise Soaps in an Iraqi refugee camp.
Findings from This Solution:
Findings from that project showed that children washed their hands four times as often with the Surprise Soaps as they did with traditional soap. Their clean behavior often spread to family members - and when that happened diseases such as cholera and pneumonia, which spread easily in crowded refugee camps, didn't. It's a simple recipe: Surprise Soaps + children = more handwashing; more handwashing = fewer diseases. For both the children themselves and their families, friends and neighbors.

The Challenge:
Iraq as a post-conflict country has been suffering from instability for decades which has been hindering the implementation of the national development agenda. The root causes of this situation are linked to economic and social problems among individuals, groups, and institutions. Therefore, the development challenges the solution seeks to address are linked to two main interlinked areas; Economic Development and Social Capital1/ Social Cohesion.

Innovation and entrepreneurship and the associated terminologies and concepts are relatively new in Iraq especially when they are linked to social impact, SDGs, and the development agenda. Thus, data and statistics in this regard are limited.

In the process of developing the energy sector to solve the power problem in Guinea, the government has electrified major cities, prefectures, and sub-prefectures. However, it emerges that despite these enormous efforts, shortcomings remain. So to provide a quick and low-cost solution, our friend “Actor's Name” gave himself body and soul to put together a micro-dam which for him will serve as a quick answer to the question of coverage and thus, influence positively on the lifestyle of local residents.

The Fiji Roads Authority (FRA) has installed solar powered streetlights along the Suva-Ba corridor, Fiji. Each streetlight will operate for approximately 13 hours at a time, from dusk till dawn. The solar lights are powered by the sun's energy, and in turn will offset carbon emissions and reduce the country's electricity generator diesel consumption. It is an innovative and environmentally-friendly adaptation approach that harnesses sustainable energy solutions to provide essential infrastructure.
25 solar streetlights would use 6,570kWh of energy from the sun and: Offset 3,357 kg of carbon emission Save electricity generator diesel consumption by 1,932 liters Equivalent to planting 23 trees

The van uses solar energy to power electrical items such as a fridge, coffee maker, and microwave. He stops in communities to chat about the van and hands out ice cream from the mobile solar-powered fridge. In doing this, he hopes to create awareness on the vast uses of solar energy, and expanding opportunities for mobile businesses. The van is also outfitted with lighting and charging points. He hopes it will encourage more locals to utilize solar energy as it is suitable to Fiji’s tropical climate, while at the same time is environmentally-friendly.

Collaborative project: Citizens participate in data collection and analysis.
Overall goal: 
Collect data that reveal the causes of air pollution and explore solutions to reverse its consequences. 
Specific goals: 
Monitor the air, analyze the data collected, and drive the ideation and implementation of policies for change. 
Description of citizen participation: The activities carried out are directly related to the environmental issues of each particular area. The B2C Social Lab plans the geographic distribution of the sensor modules by first considering the communities most affected by biomass burning. Once the area has been identified, the citizens of the affected community adopt a sensor module that is installed in their neighborhoods for a period of 2 years. 
The stored data are integrated into an open-access, user-friendly dashboard intended to be accessible to any citizen wishing to check the air quality in a given area. For this purpose, real-time data from the modules are displayed on a map with a color-coded air quality index that is easy to read. 
Periodic workshops are also held collaboratively with citizens, students, and technical personnel from SEMA Tucumán (Secretary of State for the Environment, Tucumán) and researchers from INQUINOA-UNT (Institute of Chemistry of Northwest Argentina/National University of Tucumán) for the interpretation of the data.

Healthy and empowered children are the most important addition to the human capital assets of a country. Science clearly shows that care and mental stimulation during the first few years of life are all decisive for the later cognitive and emotional development of a person. Many parents are not sufficiently aware of this fact or lack the knowledge of how to provide their children with the optimal mental stimulation and emotional skills (such as self-control and respect for others). Kindergarten is important but support is needed even earlier in life. This counselling needs to combine obstetric, pediatric, psychological, pedagogic and social expertise and support in one integrated process from pregnancy to entering school. Finland has since before WWII developed a highly successful program of this sort (called Neuvola = Counseling). (There even is the hypothesis that the top performance of Finland in PISA is more due to this early childhood support of cognitive development rather than the school system)."

Human resources are the greatest productive asset of any country as they are for any company. Bigger companies all have an HR department that comprehensively deals with all aspects of strengthening the human resource base from recruitment, to continued education to keeping the labor force in good health. At the level of national governments there typically is no comprehensive national HR strategy that addresses all components that range from demographic to health and education strategies. These aspects are dealt with by different ministries with often little collaboration. But health and education, for instance, are closely intertwined, with health problems making it more difficult to learn and more educated people typically choosing healthier life styles and staying in better health until very old age. Rather than only focusing on the institutions providing these services (as is currently done), the idea of new Ministry of Human Resources puts people and support for their comprehensive development and empowerment at the center of attention."

In order for specific communities to “work” to enable people of all ages to thrive -- including older adults -- every feature should be analyzed through the lens of aging. It doesn’t matter if there is a wonderful community center if there are no roads to reach it. Age Friendly Communities are guided by public-private councils of all the entities touching the lives of older adults. They conduct a comprehensive assessment of needs and desires through community consultations with older adults (using the WHO framework) and then audit the community through the lens of the needs identified. The council identifies top priority needs, and then encourages the partners to work together to fill them, offering seed funding to fill top priority gaps. This is a strategy to coordinate and integrate public and private sector strategies to meet locally-identified needs to successfully age in place."

As a part of the global Serbia strategy, Serbia should explicitly encourage Diaspora Direct Investments (DDI), based on encouraging Serbian diasporic investment in home regions (through specific targeted investment vehicles). Present levels of DDI are not set to transform some of the key areas of interests (education, science, technology). Unlike standard foreign direct investment or the short-term consumption that remittances boost, DDI establishes a superstructure with significant reach into the target country. This is because emigrant investors are willing to share skills, technology, and intellectual property with their former homes. Diaspora direct investments go beyond financial gains to include strengthened cultural, geographic bonds between diaspora members and home countries. If well explored, Diaspora Direct Investments may serve as a catalyst for further investments and developing social networks globally. Finally, partnerships between Foreign Direct Investment and Diaspora Direct Investments should be part of a broader strategy of Serbia."

It can be purchased as a siphon kit, with a tube connected to the filter that channels the water to a drinking water container.

Too much heat losses from conventional three stone fireplaces and other energy efficient stoves. Our scientific and technological analysis in the laboratory indicates that the most performant energy efficient stoves have an overall energy transfer rate of maximum only 25 % meaning that much of the heat supplied to the cooking pot is wasted. I am proposing a locally made heavily insulated rocket stove with proper heat flow which increases the energy transfer rate efficiency to 40% 
The unit cost if 45,000 Frs with no maintenance costs. However if massed produced with a small iron smelting plant the cost could get down to 25000 frs. Important to state that we recommend sheet metal thickness of 3mm which is quite expensive now in the market but very durable. 
Technical and economic feasibilities both positive. All materials of construction are readily available in most villages. TRL 7-TRL8

We have received another invitation for a conference in Kigali at the PACJA commonwhealth heads of state conference from June 20 to June 25th 2022.
Our laboratory analyses and tests energy efficient stoves for the public. We hardly get any stove with an efficiency of up to 25 percent. This one is 40 percent. This gives even 40 percent wood savings compared, to other stoves.

Government of Bangladesh
Establishment of biogas based electricity plants in the poultry farms reduces dependency on fossil fuel used forerunning captive generators. This also ensures bio-security and proper litter management in these farms. Moreover, slurry produced in the digesters as byproduct is a good bio-fertilizer. According to the Livestock Department, currently there are more than 150,000 poultry farms in Bangladesh with about 1,500 farms having more than 20,000 birds population. So, Bangladesh has good potential for biogas based electricity projects. Biogas plants not only provide gas for cooking purpose but also produce organic fertilizer for the crops and fish pond. The program helps reduce the use of biomass fuel for cooking. Till December 2021, IDCOL has financed construction of over 61,200 biogas plants all over the country through its 37 partner organizations. IDCOL finances plants with daily gas production capacity ranging from 1.2 m3 to 25.0 m3 thereby meeting demand of both domestic households and mid-sized dairy and poultry farms. IDCOL currently finances two models of biogas plants: brick-cement based plants and pre-fabricated bio-digester based plants. The program saves 58,750 tons of firewood ever year worth USD 4.6 million and also reduces the use of 52,000 tons of chemical fertilizer worth USD 13.6 million by producing 363,000 tons of organic fertilizer. The program also reduces 234,000 ton CO2 consumption per annum.

In Guinea, electricity is existing long time ago but with covarage holes. Added to that, in the special rural area, to mitigate power supply need and the management problem to avoid public light being active for 24H in so that the rest of the population could be served. CONDE has decided to set available his auto-managed Public Lights. Composed by a LED lightning and 220 to 12V converter, this solution can be reproduced in different format. It's particularity is the sensor incorporated in the converter that enables the switching to light when dakness comes or OFF when day light is felt. Using it can help decrease the consumption and waste of electricity.

In general case, for remote actions we see in the movies it is all about connected houses. Some households in Africa and most part of the world are wasting energy just because the owner forgot to switch off the power before leaving the place. In France, Out of 250,000 annual fires, 80,000 are of electrical origin. 40% of the victims are children under 9 years old. So to avoid such kind of problem and taking in consideration that power is very expensive ressource that should be well managed, here is a proposition of Power management with a GSM mobile phone. all you need is to send an SMS of instruction that is going to enable the requested action. So if you have to switch off any electrical component remotely, and you just have GSM coverage, this is yours!

Based on the concept 'waste to wealth', the project aims to produce high-value wooden craft products and decorations. The wood is sourced from woods of small diameter that comes from the thinning of teak wood farms. This small-diameter wood is usually known as 'kayu jaras' and is often thrown away or turned into firewood. 
The Forest Research Institute Malaysia (FRIM) has successfully organised a community programme in the effort to include the local communities in the research and development (R&D) output, particularly on the use, processing, and value-added production process from the thinning of the teak wood farm. 
The community-inclusive impact programme for the initial phase (2019-2020) of the programme was successfully implemented under the 11th Malaysia Plan (RMK11). The programme was also supported by the Malaysian Handicraft Development Corporation (Perlis branch), and the State of Perlis' Department of Forestry. 
The communities that participated in the programme were exposed to the various uses of and skills to make the handicrafts. Today, the cooperative effort has led to the pioneering of highly-skilled creative artists and woodcarvers among the communities in Perlis."

Jewelry made from invasive lionfish species in Dominica

Invasive lionfish first entered Dominica in 2011. A local marine protected area and dive shop were granted the rights to hunt the invasive species which is consumed domestically. Additionally, jewelers have been created unique crafts and products out of the species that is known to takeover reefs and reduce biodiversity due to it having no predators if left unchecked. The jewelry is one solution to this species that was originally brought to America from the Indian and Pacific Oceans via aquarium trading."

Esta solución logra producir energía con vientos de intensidad baja, a diferencia de otras turbinas eólicas pequeñas. ""Por ejemplo, se puede cargar un ordenador portátil con un viendo de unos 14 kilómetros por hora. La versión más potente -de 600 W- tan solo necesita 28 kilómetros por hora de viento para producir su máximo de energía. La idea es poder ser una turbina compacta que pueda llevarse a lugares de difícil acceso. 
Una de las características que más llama la atención es la capacidad para replegarse y almacenarse en un espacio reducido. Según recogen desde KiteX, todo el sistema cabe en un espacio de 200 x 20 x 20 centímetros."

A product that turns plastic waste into filament that can be used for 3D Printing.
The Problem:
Plastic bottles pollute our environment - Every year, millions of tons of plastic waste end up in our oceans and landfills. This pollution has a devastating effect on wildlife, and it's also one of the leading causes of climate change. Nevertheless, there are a few local recycling programs in our governorate, but the overall level of participation is low. This means that there is a lot of potential for improvement when it comes to reducing waste and increasing recycling rates.
The Solution:
There are many ways to recycle plastic, and it's not easy. It can be recycled into new products - we can use them to make new products. This machine can take these bottles and convert them into 3D printer filament to make products. Hence, the solution is about developing a 3D printer filament recycling machine which is a device that can recycle plastic bottles into 3D printing filament. This machine consists of two parts: an electronic part and a mechanical part. The electronic part controls the motor that powers the blade, while the mechanical part contains the blade itself."

What is Origins?
Origins is a personal incubation; aims to put participants on the driver’s seat on a safe, fun and well-designed learning journey. The destination of their journey is to enter the private sector as entry level employees or as interns by developing their knowledge, skills and attitudes. This program is implemented and owned by a local startup called Doinc for Business Development and Consultation.
All the cultures we know asked the same question themselves: how did the world come to be? How were people and life born? And nowadays, we as humans are asking about how these cultures were born, and by basic logic, you can figure out that we asked about things – cultures, religions, and even the universe itself self- happened many decades, centuries ago and such questions are driven by curiosity and the desire of knowing how did they establish memorable buildings, figures, and ideas that dominated the human history; as Steve Jobs once said, you can only connect dots looking to the past to reshape the future we believe that it is time to ask our self about things happens in our daily life, it is time to back to origins. Going back to our origins means looking for patterns in the experiences that formulated persons who made the harmonious work environment and experience that shaped their attitude, behavior and knowledge; looking for the same elements that those persons had during their lives to be what they had become later. This understanding is not the purpose itself; it is to pave the way for those who can join private sector after that. At Origins, we aim to create and improve the knowledge, attitude, and behavior in a way fits with the participants entry to the Iraqi local market as an employee provides practical value reinforce by theoretical and technique knowledge in their matters of interest.
The main purpose of Origins overall is to provides participants with swords and shield to enter the private sector throughout leading companies. While this version is aiming to the same purpose but through the gate of Doinc as interns.
https://fb.watch/hw3WijhGQW/?mibextid=v7YzmG
Objectives:
1. Validating the program design in matters of learning theory and development of participants. 2. Prepare 10 – 15 participants to enter in this year the private sector as interns or entry level employees by developing their skills, knowledge, and attitude. 3. Talent Acquisition: create a talent pool of 15 participant which we will be interested to hire some of them as interns by the end of this program.
Elements of Origins:

La Mesa Directiva para la Protección y Conservación del Bosque la Montañona es una iniciativa creada en el año 2021 por los líderes propietarios del bosque con el apoyo de la Mancomunidad La Montañona. Está compuesta por actores públicos así como privados que, a través de una actitud solidaria, decidieron unirse y establecer acuerdos comunes para la conservación del área natural en Chalatenango.
Esta es una Solución Medioambiental de Base que ha sido identificada por el Laboratorio de Aceleración del Programa de las Naciones Unidas para el Desarrollo en el marco de la Gira de Mapeo de Soluciones Medioambientales de Base.
Tipo de solución
Modelo asociativo para la protección de bosque.
Descripción
Debido a la contaminación ambiental que sufrió el bosque en el contexto de la Guerra Civil en El Salvador, así como también a diversas actividades nocivas que realizan hoy en día los habitantes de la comunidad como tirar basura, tala indiscriminada de árboles para madera, y robo de plantas que han sido sembradas por los propietarios, el bosque se ha dañado considerablemente. A razón de esto, nace la idea de crear una mesa directiva representada por los propietarios mayoritarios de tierras. El principal objetivo de esta asociación es la protección del Bosque La Montañona así como también el lograr mantener una buena gestión del área natural de manera que pueda convertirse en un sitio turístico en Chalatenango.
El proceso de conformación de la mesa directiva siguió la siguiente dinámica: en diciembre de 2021 se invitó a los propietarios de tierras a un taller para definir el acuerdo de conformación de la Mesa Directiva. En marzo del 2022 se realizó la primera reunión en la que asistieron todos los actores, tanto públicos como privados involucrados. La mesa se reúne dos veces al mes para apostarle a un proyecto turístico que involucre a todos los propietarios del bosque. Está compuesta por siete actores, distribuidos de la siguiente manera:
El CORVELAN (155 propietarios - 508 manzanas), Cooperativa de vainillas (85 propietarios - 266 manzanas - grupos colectivos), Municipalidad del Carrizal (174 manzanas - propiedad ejidal), ISTA (192 manzanas), 3 Propietarios privados (368 manzanas).
Las proyecciones futuras que se quieren concretar abarcan la creación de un taller ampliado para presentación del Plan de Trabajo de la Mesa Directiva, la construcción de casetas informativas distribuidas en el territorio que abarca el bosque, y la realización de una reunión en la que se inviten al Ministerio de Agricultura y Ganadería, Ministerio de Desarrollo Local, y Ministerio de Turismo, así como también a la Dirección General de Ordenamiento Forestal.
¿Qué hace a esta Mesa Directiva diferente?
Frente a la falta de una organización, se decidió crear esta iniciativa con el objetivo de regular el uso de la zona protegida y que no se lleven a cabo prácticas dañinas para el bosque. Se creó la mesa por problemáticas en común, se protege el bosque y no se permite la extracción de madera, así como tampoco la recuperación de espacios verdes a consejo de biólogos y técnicos. Lo que se busca es generar un plan turístico para la montañona sin necesidad de dañar al bosque.
La actitud proactiva de proteger a la montaña le ha dado cuerpo a la mesa directiva. El éxito radica en la voluntad de los actores por trabajar en la protección del bosque. A partir de esto, se está desarrollando un Plan de Manejo de Bosques, y se ha iniciado la búsqueda para encontrar posibles socios estratégicos que puedan apoyar en las gestiones necesarias para el objetivo en común de la mesa.
Otra de las cosas interesantes de la mesa es a parte de la actitud proactiva también una actitud solidaria entre los propietarios, ya que se tiene una visión en común y se busca proteger el bosque bajo consenso de todos. La Mancomunidad cuenta con un fondo para mejoramiento de infraestructura turística.

Description

In Bangladesh, approximately 73 million individuals still lack access to safe water within their own homes. Merely 2% of rural households have the privilege of obtaining water through a piped water supply, meaning that an overwhelming 98% of rural households in Bangladesh are deprived of this convenience. The arduous task of collecting water falls on women and girls, who spend up to two hours each day engaged in this chore. Moreover, majority of households rely on potentially hazardous tube wells. Consequently, rural families, particularly children, face a heightened risk of diarrhoea, malnutrition, and stunted growth.
As a solution to this pressing issue, Max TapWater develops and operates mini grids for the provision of piped water supply, aiming to bring easy, safe, and affordable water to rural households in Bangladesh. By availing
this water supply services, households gain access to a continuous 24/7 water supply directly from their taps, with a minimum allocation of 80-100 litres per person per day across three water points within their homes (kitchen, toilet, and bathroom). Regular water quality testing is conducted to ensure the water's safety. The construction of these grids is not technically complex and relies on locally sourced materials. The innovation lies in the entrepreneurial model employed, which operates within small clusters of households and involves local entrepreneurs who can co-invest. 
Max TapWater was a grant recipient of the Youth Co:Lab Bangladesh's Springboard programme 4.0, a collaborative initiative by the UNDP and Citi Foundation."

Polluted water travels and passes by filtering ponds and levels before arriving to farms or before community use. Communities chose the filtering plants to be used, which generate a bacteria that reduces metal pollution. Water becomes usable for agricultural purposes (not drinking).

The organization was founded in 2017 with a focus of developing innovative appropriate solutions and offer practical training, their belief is that innovation is a vital part of development of new industries and the industrial transformation to create a smarter society in Africa. Flash floods affect many parts of Kampala city causing heavy rainfall, poorly maintained drainage systems, waste disposal in drainage channels, silting in natural channels and improper house planning of city suburbs contribute to the flooding. In 2020 alone Kampala experienced over 4 deadly flash floods which have left more than two dead and caused not only city-wide disruptions on travel and businesses but also destruction of properties and wide spread of water-borne diseases. Saerd’s main goal is to develop multi-dimensional structural and non-structural approach to control occasional floods and simultaneously mitigate future flood occurrences, currently the existing flood control measures include desilting of the channels to curb the floods regular maintenance of drainages but are inadequate. Saerd’s solution entails the structural measures which include water harvesting & multi-storage (i.e., underground reservoirs, drainage pumps). While there is a possibility of channeling this water to Lake Victoria, it can serve water needs in other sectors such as urban agriculture and industries. Moreover, underground water storage systems are one of the most sustainable approaches that has worked in other countries, for example, the one of Tokyo called the floodwater cathedral hidden 22 meters underground. The integration of the public-private partnership (PPP Model) into Saerd’s solution to drive capacity and sustainability is vital for providing much-needed support for monitoring, management and facility use. The following can be expected at the end of the project: 1. A feasibility study plan for flood control and storm water management of the Kampala city. 2. A Master plan on comprehensive flood and storm water management entailing structural and non-structural measures. 3. Designed and constructed multi storage, underground tanks/reservoirs, drainage pumps and Water harvesting system. 4. Addition of new opportunities in the job market. 5. Development of a new flood forecasting and warning system.

It's a pure behaviour change and action-oriented activity that focuses on exercise and promotes the idea of sustainable cities and communities through a transformative act of jogging and picking up trash. The initiative tracks kilometers covered, calories burnt, the amount of segregated trash (recyclable and non-recyclable) picked up during the drive as tangibles to measure impact. The central aim is to build communities through plogging that adopt sustainable waste practices like segregation of waste at source into wet and dry, composting, adopting a single-use plastic-free life, among others. A significant part of this initiative also deals with empowering youth and communities with agency and capacity-building so that they can encourage others societies to rally for cleanliness and proper waste management practices.

Madagascar was the major exporter amounting to 60.1% of total exports, while Indonesia's exports stood at 5.56%. Indonesia's capacity to produce vanilla made it clear that Malaysia was also capable of producing and exporting high grade vanilla. Yet, the vanilla industry is wrought with problems: issues of ethics and sustainability, low yield at 40% - making vanilla one of the world's scarcest goods. The vanilla farm pioneered by Kairos Agriculture is the first smart vanilla farm with patent technology in Malaysia that integrates Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), big data application, nanotechnology and machine learning to sustainably grow vanilla. Its objectives are to: 1. grow sustainable and ethically produced vanilla crops 2. leverage agritech to encourage more young people to venture into agriculture business 3. create jobs and improve the living standards of B40 and disadvantaged groups. Kairos partners with local institutions for research to improve and enhance crop farming towards optimum quantity and quality of vanilla planting. The group also has a portable module that can be built in schools collaboratively to help the school sustain an independent income stream with a buyback scheme. It also adopts various energy and resource-saving technologies that ranges from: 1. chemical-free planting, with the use of recycled crop residue as compost 2. production of Efficient Microbes (EM) with the fruit waste collected from local wet market 3. automated irrigation system that is activated according to the weather 4. rainwater harvesting system and full-LED usage in the farm."

In Quito, around 2,000 to 2,400 tons of garbage are generated daily. That means that every 2 months we Quiteños can fill the Atahualpa Olympic Stadium with garbage. Likewise, the production of garbage in the city continues to grow exponentially.

More than half of the garbage we generate is organic waste and it can be easily decomposed. That is, they do not need large amounts of energy to transform. Despite this, they are a source of pollution since if they are not used correctly they produce methane (CH4), which is 25 times more polluting than carbon dioxide (CO2).

Quito lacks an effective treatment for the management of organic waste. This solution was found when ideating about how herbalists could increase their livelihoods and use their surplus medicinal plants in a way that it didn ́t get wasted. Composting is an interesting alternative, but for them, it requires transportation from the market to their plots to compost and time, which is very scarce.

Although energy access in Bangladesh has drastically improved in recent years in terms of the number of connections, the challenge of today mainly lies in assuring quality service for those connections at an affordable cost to the consumer and the government. Load shedding was a common phenomenon in the past, but since the latter half of 2022, its rate of occurrence has been on the rise again. The fear of load shedding is further increasing with the number of energy-hungry electric vehicles on the roads. While the adoption of renewable energies is slowly improving, their potential is far from utilised.
A discussion white paper by Solshare (link to the paper shared below), a climate-tech startup based in Dhaka, Bangladesh, explores the role of electric rickshaws (three-wheeler vehicle prevalent in Bangladesh), also known as e-rickshaws, in virtual power plants (VPPs) as an innovative solution to the above problems. Virtual power plants are cloud-based systems that manage and optimize various distributed energy resources such as solar panels, batteries, electric vehicles, and, in this case, rickshaws. By connecting and coordinating multiple individual rickshaws, the rickshaw VPP acts as a decentralized energy storage and generation source. The International Energy Agency recognizes VPPs as crucial for achieving a carbon-neutral or net-zero economy.
Through the VPP, e-rickshaw batteries can be efficiently charged and discharged, their capacity aggregated, and their energy usage optimized based on grid conditions, demand, and other factors. This allows e-rickshaws not only to serve as transportation vehicles but also to contribute to the stability and resilience of the electricity grid as distributed energy resources, facilitating the integration of renewable energy.
The solshare paper highlights that, at the end of a driver's day, approximately 25% to 30% of battery charge remains. Using the VPP, this excess electricity can be sold to the grid during peak demand hours and repurchased during low-demand periods, enabling the driver to earn extra income while helping stabilize the grid and address load shedding issues. The cost of fully charging the vehicle at night is much cheaper for the driver compared to selling electricity during peak demand, creating a financial advantage.
One of the significant advantages of VPPs is that they provide grid operators with a comprehensive understanding of the combined load. Additionally, they offer precise information about specific distribution lines, known as feeders. Unlike traditional load-shedding methods that consider only sanctioned load levels, VPPs take into account real-time actual load data. This enhanced visibility of the actual load enables more connections to remain online during periods of low load and allows feeders with renewable energy feed-in points to remain connected, promoting increased integration of renewable energy into the grid.
Affordability is another key benefit of VPPs. Participation in VPPs provides direct compensation to homes and businesses. Additionally, VPPs reduce wholesale energy and fuel costs by shifting demand to low- or no-marginal-cost resources, as opposed to relying on expensive peaking resources.
The technology builds on what is readily available today. The components and mechanisms of the Rickshaw VPP are
detailed in the image below.

The Washing Machine Project is a social enterprise dedicated to alleviating the burden of hand washing clothes globally, a burden that often falls on women and girls.
The challenge: during displacement, women and girls often bear the burden of hand washing, spending up to 8 hours per week hand washing and consuming up to 40 liters per washing cycle.
The solution: a single, standalone, off the grid washing machine (WM) that will be affordable, portable and accessible for everyone. The WM reduces the washing cycle time to 30 minutes instead of 60-80 min, resulting in time saved which can be put towards more productive uses and will reduce the amount of water used per washing cycle to 10 liters instead of 20-40 liters, addressing the water-scarce conditions in IDP camps.

Private sector companies are severely impacted by covid-19 lock-down. The impact varies from businesses who lost part of their market share to others who closed. This led to increased unemployment. The still existing businesses were impacted due to gaps in their administrative systems. 
On the other side, other businesses started at the time of lock-down, they are entirely costumed to match the requirements of lock-down, and they may not be useful in the post-pandemic period.
COVID-venture is a start-up training programme that gathers most common systemic problems from the struggling private sector companies, then trains youth entrepreneurs on problem solving methodologies, and business model.

El estatuto de trabajadores intermitentes del espectáculo en Francia es el resultado de una lucha social de los trabajadores de las artes escénicas, cuya forma de trabajo requiere un tratamiento particular. Principalmente, la intermitencia, consiste en períodos de actividad laboral por cuenta ajena con pausas, lo cual vulnera sus condiciones y protección social.
El estatuto fue creado en 1936 con la finalidad de acoger a estos trabajadores, creando un régimen de cotización y protección social alternativo para un trabajo flexible. Este modelo extiende la subvención con dinero público de los empresarios del espectáculo a sus trabajadores. El estatuto permite la obtención automática
de prestaciones de desempleo en cada periodo de inactividad que sucede entre contratos de trabajo.
En el 2007 y 2013 se reformó por falta de presupuesto y quedó:
Los intermitentes que se hayan quedado inactivos deben justificar un periodo de afiliación de al menos 507 horas de trabajo en el espectáculo dentro de los 304 días precedentes al fin de su contrato en el caso de los técnicos, 319 días en el caso de los artistas. Antes de la reforma se tenía en cuenta un periodo de un año. (Una jornada está limitada a 12 horas máximo). Con la reforma, la prestación se redujo de un año a 8 meses."

El gobierno de México, a través del Ministerio de Agricultura, introdujo el seguro de índices climáticos en 2003. El principal objetivo del programa es apoyar a los pequeños agricultores, con un máximo de 20 hectáreas, y que sufren de contingencias climáticas atípicas –particularmente sequías, pero también inundaciones y bajas temperaturas—para que se incorporen de nuevo a sus actividades productivas. 
Los productores individuales no pagan nada para obtener la cobertura, ya que está contratada de forma conjunta por los gobiernos federales y estatales. Los agricultores quedan automáticamente inscritos en el programa si viven dentro de las regiones aseguradas. 
Si bien este no es un tipo de “afiliación”, el seguro climático ofrece recuperación de inversión frente adversidades de cambio climático. El seguro aumenta la producción porque los agricultores se sienten más seguros de continuar con su productividad.
Consideraciones para replicar: Se requiere de infraestructura específica como estaciones climatológicas de buena calidad que lleven funcionando varias décadas y que se cuente con observaciones de lluvia y temperatura diarias por periodos de tiempo largos, así como una inversión importante para analizar la relación entre la semilla del producto, el tipo de tierra cerca de la estación climatológica, y el mínimo necesario de humedad y temperatura que la planta necesita para tener un desarrollo fenológico natural con el fin de establecer los umbrales para los contratos de seguro."

Thus arose a strategy to reactivate the livelihoods of a network of seamstress, immigrant and national families. Through theoretical and practical training in the manufacture of protective suits, this network would obtain financial recognition.
From its start, it was clear that this undertaking would not only remain in the manufacture of these equipment, but would also have an emphasis on promoting collaborative, open and horizontal forms of organization.

Deforestation. Burning wood is dramatically less carbon-efficient than burning LPG. Wood consists of 50% fuel. The rest is molecularly-bound oxygen plus left-over moisture. Neither of these burns and vaporising the moisture wastes energy. LPG, by contrast, is all fuel. Per unit of delivered cooking heat, burning wood generates about five times the carbon of LPG. Switching from wood to LPG reduces cooking’s carbon emissions significantly. In Uganda, where much traditional cooking happens, switching from wood fuel to LPG cuts net-CO2 output to the atmosphere by 60%.
Switching 100 households from consuming 200 tonnes of harvested wood a year to consume instead 21.5 tonnes of LPG would save one hectare of forest each year."

Contributory project: It is designed by scientists, and citizens participate in data collection. 
Overall goal: Study freshwater environments (rivers, lakes, lagoons and estuaries) both for scientific and educational purposes Specific goals: The scientific purpose is to analyze the condition of inland water ecosystems using citizen participation strategies. Particularly, the project aims to: identify the environmental factors that positively and negatively impact freshwater ecosystems; generate new tools for monitoring such ecosystems; and calibrate existing tools for assessment. Besides, the educational purpose is to create materials related to the preservation of freshwater ecosystems. To achieve such purpose, the project aims at: drawing up simple manuals for monitoring said ecosystems to be used in educational activities; making available to educational institutions maps showing the condition of courses of freshwater; and educating on scientific reasoning, by directly involving citizen scientists in some or all stages of the scientific method. 
Description of citizen participation: Citizen scientists assess habitat condition in aquatic environments by using an app for Android or a website. The information sent is concentrated in the AppEAR database and used to create a real-time map showing aquatic habitat conditions, both of which may be freely accessed. Also, citizen scientists are able to learn about the aquatic environments present in their communities and educate others using the educational resources generated by themselves. Citizen interaction and active involvement in discussion forums are useful to measure habitat quality in aquatic environments, to learn how to generate educational resources for these ecosystems, and even to improve AppEAR.

Collaborative project: Citizens participate in data collection and analysis.
Description of citizen participation: Citizens take part in recording species by providing accurate coordinates and dates, photographs, video or audio recordings. 
Overall goals: • Identify species. • Create species datasheets. • Disseminate the findings of scientific research. • Perform a leisure activity. Specific goals: • Mapping and determining the geographic distribution of different species on the basis of the data recorded by the community, considering three options: – All records, including those which are not supported by evidence. This implies that more data will be displayed on datasheets and maps. This is very useful for easily identified species. – Only records supported by evidence. This means that datasheets and maps will contain more reliable data, which may be easily validated. This is very useful for species which are harder to identify. – Only such records containing reproduction information. This requires knowledge on species reproduction, and all geographic data which are not relevant to this topic will be discarded. • Generate lists of species for each country, province and district. • Record nature-related events. • Generate personal statistics for each user regarding the species recorded, the number of records entered, and the areas visited.

Co-created project: Citizens participate in all stages of the scientific process.
Overall goals: • Highlight the importance of crowdsourcing data which may be later used for optimal water resource management. • Promote interinstitutional and intra-institutional work, by encouraging the partaking of students at different educational levels. • Foster the involvement of public and private schools of any kind. • Plan the participation of residents in recording hydrometeorological data. Specific goals: • Record and analyze weather data to characterize particular physical phenomena (for example, heavy storms) occurring in the area; also, contribute to the determination of certain methodological aspects and to instrumentation making. • Establish ties at every educational level between public and private educational establishments. • Crowdsource data to co-create knowledge with the aim to mitigate the effects of environmental hazards (floods, droughts, wildfires, pollution, etc.) 
Description of citizen participation: Children and young people carry out hydrological and hydrometeorological measurements and build their own low-cost instruments. These instruments are validated by comparison with official instruments (for example, the instruments are installed in the National Weather Service educational experimental fields). Additionally, the students are promoters of what they have learned, applying it to their daily environment. Private residents have been incorporated to collaborate with data recording, giving rise to MATTEO R., where the R in the last name (Ravagli) refers to Residents. Today, schools from the MATTEO project are currently participating in international scientific projects such as PREVENIR project, funded by the Science Agency of Japan.

Contributory project: It is designed by scientists, and citizens participate in data collection.
Overall goal: Continue the recent developments of the Working Group (WP) by improving the capture of flash flood videos and optimizing the performance of the software being developed by the WG for processing the flood images recorded by citizens. The discharges estimated on the basis of crowdsourced data will be reported to the authorities for flood hazard management. Specific goals: • Give citizens the chance to share flood videos through a website to be later analyzed by the WG. • Work on two new pillars for recording higher quality videos: 1) Selection of favorite sites for video recording identified by the WG together with the local Civil Defense personnel previously trained (by the WG) on video capture. A field survey is conducted in order to assess such topographic characteristics of the site as required for video processing. 2) Automation of video processing at fixed gauging stations using security cameras. These pillars require constant technological development at every stage of the process, namely: during video recording and processing, as well as during data transfer to authorities. • Continue the development required by each stage so as to maximize systematization and minimize human intervention. The goal is to optimize the software developed by the WG using tailor-made hardware. 
Description of citizen participation: Citizens, firefighters, civil defense staff, and law enforcement personnel record videos of flash floods in urban rivers and basins. Then, the videos are sent to a team of scientists who will process the relevant data. The material can be sent through the project’s website and social networks, or by contacting members of the GDT and sharing it by e-mail.

During the pandemic, the imposed mobility and physical presence restrictions accelerated the need to advance in digitalization processes. In areas where there is no financial infrastructure (far from banks, ATMs, and payment centers) and the use of digital systems is scarce, some stores saw an opportunity to cover that existing need by offering services related to the use of digital platforms, mainly but not exclusively, to make online payments, as an additional offer to their core business (bookstore, pharmacy, among others). Apart from stores, this form of service may also be offered by individuals (charging by each person’s income) or in community spaces (free of charge). In all cases, the users value proximity and reliability the most. Social manager networks (also known as territorial integrators) offer support and advice to complete procedures mainly related to social programs, IDs, printing, and photocopies by using their own technological devices. These networks also played other social roles for the community. “(...) we appointed her as social manager. She is in touch with the bank staff and can help manage banking procedures. She helps to manage the Emergency Family Income (IFE, by its initials in Spanish), Cuenta DNI (free-of-charge digital wallet), CBU (bank routing number), and online procedures.” (Referent, city of Buenos Aires). From “Shared Search: CoLaborative Solutions Mapping”. Social organizations also offered digital consulting services. Neighbors explain that they resort to this service because they have difficulties in completing the procedures, either due to a lack of knowledge of the red tape, understanding the apps, having connectivity, or modern devices. To use the service, they initially seek advice on how to proceed and then return with the necessary documentation. “We are often asked to help with digital procedures. Most of them don’t have a computer, and mobile phones don’t allow them to access these procedures”. (Referent, city of Buenos Aires). From “Shared Search: CoLaborative Solutions Mapping”. This type of service appeared as a response to the lack of nearby infrastructure for the payment of utilities, with the corresponding costs, time, and needed arrangements associated with traveling to carry out these operations, a low level of literacy, confidence and/or security in the use of cell phones, and a lack of connectivity. Additionally, this intermediation not only makes payments easier, but also allows completing different procedures that are difficult to understand, complex to manage, or involve fulfilling requirements which are hard to be explained (e.g. applying for the Universal Child Allowance [AUH, by its initials in Spanish], the Workers Identification Number [CUIL, by its initials in Spanish] certificate, the Student Travel Ticket, etc.) The basis for this informal intermediation is trust, a result of the nearness of the neighborhood where it is the same people that live there who “assist” with these tasks, and, what is more, most of the new customers come due to recommendation by other neighbors. This service is so necessary for places with less infrastructure that some customers come from other neighborhoods to carry out these operations. The virtual space still appears to be a very distant and hostile environment for worse-off people and it highlights the importance of support as regards the completion of complex transactions for users. As a lesson, the design of financial tools for left-behind populations must take trust and proximity to infrastructure as an input to work. In contrast to the traditional offer, the adoption of new financial and digital services by local stores, equipped with computers and Internet access, stands out. In turn, this type of solution boosts local markets, and also decompresses and decentralizes procedures. Moreover, when geographic proximity is combined with other variables, such as peer-to-peer trust, this alternative becomes more meaningful. This solution of informal intermediation was also tested through a strategic alliance with a local municipality in the province of Entre Ríos. The “Con Vos” (With You) Network aimed to encourage the adoption of these services by stores, and at the same time, to experiment with the best tools for the success of this action. This activity managed to promote digital literacy through collaboration among people in the same neighborhood, develop local markets by improving the management capability of merchants and increasing their sales, and avoid the gathering of people in offices to take care of their health. Finally, this action has encouraged the municipality to digitalize more procedures, thus promoting open government and smart cities from citizenship to government.

Difficulty in accessing different financial services is a historical problem for low-income sectors. Overall, households have a low level of financial soundness and their access to the labor market—mostly precarious and/or temporary—means they are mostly in the informal sector of the economy. This makes them extremely vulnerable to macroeconomic changes, emergencies, or unforeseen events. In this context, interpersonal agreements based on trust and closeness gain relevance. Family and/or community credit wheels—also known as Pasanakus—are structured within the neighborhoods and may be made up of small groups or a larger number of people, as long as participants know each other. Based on an individual monetary contribution agreed by the members, a common fund of money is consolidated and its distribution can take two forms: i) simultaneous request for money or ii) the chronological order in which the money is received, given at random or according to the members’ needs. In the case of Pasanakus, there is usually a monthly contribution, and the total amount is systematically drawn among members. Participants take turns to receive the money on a monthly basis until, finally, all the members of the group have received the total amount of contributions. One of the members takes up the role of organizer, as someone is needed to collect payments and distribute the gathered amount; this person tends to receive the first sum as a benefit for their work. Access to financing—at all levels—represents a widespread tool within low-income populations and a strategy to create solidarity finance in response to the absence of traditional financial services adapted to low-income populations. This implies the democratization of financial resources at the service of the community since it allows access to the necessary economic resources for livelihood and economic activities. This solution stood out, particularly, during our gender mapping, where we focused on financial inclusion solutions through a gender lens. The interviewed women shed light on the Pasanaku circle: “One of the boys that I told you about, his parents play Pasanaku, (...). One family puts in two thousand pesos, another family puts in two thousand pesos and the other one puts two thousand pesos. After they all put the two thousand, they draw a number and, during that month, the Gómez family gets all the money. After that, they draw another number and it's like they're rotating. It's like the money rotates, it doesn't stay there. So, when someone else needs money to build their house (...), they play that game, which is a profitable game, because the money goes around, it is not that they are losing, your number is always going to come out, the thing is that it rotates.” Interview #21 young woman from “Mujeres en red: soluciones financieras y de recuperación socioeconómica” (Women in Network: Financial and Socioeconomic Recovery Solutions). Community finances are a space for savings and access to money within the neighborhoods that are based on a verbal agreement among participants. Part of their successful operation and long-term continuity has to do with the fact that they are built on trust, based on mutual knowledge among participants, and solidarity, as a result of the understanding from sharing the same situation or having experienced it at some point in time. Participants are all equally interested in generating this amount of savings that otherwise would have been out of their reach without the intermediation of financial institutions or moneylenders. Indirectly, the Pasanaku allows to reach savings that could be destined for bigger projects in terms of time, effort, and results, such as structural home improvements, setting up small businesses, or other economic activities. Finally, we should note that solutions like the Pasanaku or credit wheel become less efficient in an inflationary context, as they operate with non-indexed amounts. Nevertheless, only a few interviewees recognized this problem, and, despite this, they use this solution because of the previously mentioned reasons. What it’s clear is that inflation represents a clear obstacle to savings-generating solutions.

During the pandemic, the mandatory isolation measures underscored the weakness of small shopkeepers and/or producers’ marketing channels. This situation was aggravated by the closure of “non-essential” businesses and the ban on public meetings and/or mobility in public spaces, which made open-air fairs and street selling impossible. Faced with this scenario, people continued their economic activities through the virtual space in different ways. The UNPD Argentina Accelerator Lab (Co_Lab) was able to identify these new strategies through our work in the territories illustrated in the report “Shared search: CoLaborative solutions mapping”, which was carried out in the middle of the quarantine period. The first solution identified during this fieldwork was how informal ways of trading such as open-air fairs or barters became “virtual” through social media, allowing money to circulate, which is fundamental in terms of economic recovery. This form did not involve charging commissions on sales, but it did come with new considerations on how to work better (photo quality, product descriptions, live streaming, etc.). In turn, participation in a virtual fair group also involves agreeing on ways of exchange. Based on the interaction with potential customers, an agreement is made on payment methods, either in cash or by digital means, and delivery methods, carried out through a delivery system or a street meeting to complete the transaction. One of the main characteristics of this type of fair is maintaining the proximity of the market, that is, between buyers and sellers, since most of them are restricted to a neighborhood or local space. WhatsApp, Facebook, or Instagram groups indicate the neighborhood or town to which they belong to avoid transactions with high shipping costs or, as one neighbor pointed out, to “sell to your own neighbors whom you already know.” In other words, the mapping showed that this type of fair maintains its neighborhood spirit even in the virtual world. They act as digital marketplaces where the products offered are posted with photos and detailed descriptions on WhatsApp or Facebook groups. It is a widely used strategy to market local products and services, and for exchange or barter. If neighbors want to join a WhatsApp group, they must request access to someone they know. In Co_Lab’s most recent mapping “Mujeres en Red” (Women in Network), it was possible to observe that this solution usage was very extended among women from low-income neighborhoods, understood as a solution linked to women’s economic autonomy. In this context, 3 versions of the solution could be identified: ● Trading of secondhand products: Women identify and select some of their belongings at home that they no longer use and can be sold. They check the conditions of the products, wash them, and organize them for sale. ● Producing and/or intervening products: Women use their knowledge to design, prepare, cook, knit/sew. In any of these cases, an initial purchase of material is needed. ● Resale: It entails a previous in-bulk purchase, which requires investing capital beforehand. This could be linens, cloths, cleaning supplies, etc. Women select what to buy, where, how much and, depending on the product, how to fraction it. The virtualization of local commercial relations at no extra cost was made possible by the wide-spread access to cell phones with internet connection and digital means of payments. The testimonies gathered from interviews with women shed light on this solution: “It started with the pandemic, people started to sell things and use WhatsApp groups... the one who sells pastries, secondhand clothes, cleaning supplies. A girl living around the corner said: ‘I’m going to set up a WhatsApp group’. Now there are more than 100 of us. It started with only 4 blocks, and the girl started receiving comments such as: ‘Can you add my cousin?’. And now it gets all the way to the train station that is more than 30 blocks away. They set up meeting points halfway, so you move and I move. It expanded and expanded. Now there are a lot of them (WhatsApp groups) in the neighborhoods, 2 or 3 that are very big [...] You add most of the contacts you make so later on you get to see them through their WhatsApp statuses”. Interview #29, adult woman, from “Mujeres en red: soluciones financieras y de recuperación socioeconómica” (Women in Network: Financial and Socioeconomic Recovery Solutions). Once products are published for sale, prices are set at a value that is accessible to the virtual community in which they are operating. Many times, the possibility of barter is also stated. These offers can be seen in a WhatsApp status, a Facebook live transmission, or Instagram stories. Most of the time, the items for sale are seen by a close circle of friends, relatives, or neighbors, though these Facebook lives or Instagram stories can reach a bigger market that may include strangers, but always inside this local logic of word-of-mouth commercialization. Above all, recreating the “fair” in the virtual world implies improving social media skills, developing digital marketing capabilities, and using different audiovisual resources to “promote” products and gain market share. Some of the reasons for women to choose this type of solution are: ● It mobilizes resources they already have at their disposal: their cell phones, internet connection, products they don’t use anymore, digital social networks, community networks, among other things. ● It transforms digital social networks into their workspace: they are no longer used only for entertainment or communication purposes. The pandemic accelerated their usage to build a work agenda and the corresponding content dissemination. ● It allowed to maintain a certain level of economic activity through commercialization, community logic, and local bonds. ● It allows for the same income as a daily informal job. ● It allows women to be present at home taking care of children, elders, or people with disabilities. ● It boosts community and collaboration. Apart from the “virtual” fair, digital social networks continued to be used after mobility restrictions were eased. When WhatsApp or Facebook closed buying and selling groups evolved into a local in-person fair, a solution of a permanent working space with digital channels appeared. Women choose this solution for the same reasons previously mentioned, and above all, because the possibility of having a physical space that facilitates communication and dissemination of information on local dynamics adds value for these entrepreneurs. In these spaces, neighbors can find out about new economic activities, public policies, and social programs. They can also share experiences from the pandemic and help each other to deal with digital procedures (see “Informal Intermediation of Digital Procedures Solution). The connection with the digital sphere manifests itself, for example, when raffles take place and the event is transmitted online for those who could not attend, or to share special offers with regular customers. To install oneself in this fair, it is important to have enough capital to invest in furniture such as trestles, boards, or blankets. It is also useful to have previous selling experience. When one of these local businesses grows enough through the help of social digital networks, the opportunity to move to a commercial facility appears. This means to have a physical store and support from an online one. Capital, time and long-time planning are needed for this type of project, but there is an expectation for stable employment and income associated with these small family businesses. Finally, other alternatives identified in our mapping campaigns were virtual stores on the internet and catalog advance sales. The first ones are alternative websites, with formal operating rules, for the digital sale of products made by popular, social, and solidarity-based economy and/or family farming enterprises. Their main characteristic is that products are developed by civil society organizations or academic centers; this enables the sharing of knowledge and technical resources necessary to develop them. On the other hand, sales by catalog allow entrepreneurs or heads of household to sell their products in advance through a digital catalog shared on social media or WhatsApp, at a much lower cost than those currently available on the market. Unlike other alternatives, this type of solution allows individuals to generate income without prior resources. In all these solutions, the movement of goods and services at affordable prices is one of the main factors creating expectations among consumers who participate in these types of exchange networks. At the same time, they allow the movement of secondhand and new products, and offer great flexibility in terms of payment methods by incorporating electronic means, but also by allowing face-to-face transactions to close the deal on some occasions. Finally, the bonds of trust, reciprocity, and closeness are factors that also explain the power of this type of solution in a context of crisis. Trust in this type of network and its participants (whether sellers or consumers) is key to guarantee a commercial exchange.

The majority of rural communities do not have access to treated mosquito nets, and do not have access to preventive measures. The government of Uganda is investing efforts in the reduction of malaria by providing interventions like the distribution of mosquito nets, or spraying homes with DDT. Malaria cases still remain high because the solutions are not long lasting and mosquito nets are only effective during sleep time. DDT is raising also severe health concerns due to its chemical components.
Malaria is one of today’s major global health challenges and has been associated with slow socioeconomic development and poverty. Uganda has some of the highest reported malaria transmission rates in the world, with approximately 16 million cases reported in 2013 and over 100 000 deaths annually."

This will result in low power usage at household level and saving of electricity, whose efficiency has greatly been affect by prolonged draughts since the country depends on hydro generated power."

Curious to see how fellow Namibians were addressing issues that are directly or indirectly affecting them during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Accelerator Lab in collaboration with our partner Launch Namibia conceptualized a digital solution safari. The solution safari was a social media campaign that looked at COVID-19 related products and services developed or adapted by not only entrepreneurs but as well as community members in underserved areas. 
Our aim with this campaign was to highlight entrepreneurs who are making a difference within their communities, we were specifically looking at entrepreneurs sharing useful information on COVID-19, gathering resources that can be donated to the less privileged or making innovative strides as entrepreneurs to ensure that they not only continue working but also inspiring others to follow suit. This digital safari was also a means to highlight and collate information on locally owned solutions outside of the entrepreneurship space. Our main way of engaging followers on social media was through a call to action where followers of both UNDP and Launch accounts were asked to submit information regarding community members who have developed COVID-19 specific solutions.
1. Kaushiwetu Johannes came up with a hygiene hand-was system to aid the fight against the pandemic, his design can be customised to suit the needs of the community and it comes in various sizes. The design also allows for multiple people to use it at the same time. 

2.Ingo Shangyenge through his start-up Inansa Investment has been manufacturing masks for essential staff as well as the public at large.
3. Emmerancia Van Wyk has been providing nutritious meals to between 250 & 300 children daily who were formerly dependent on their school feeding schemes while educating them on COVID-19
4. Linda Ndakolo whose start-up manufactures cleaning materials donated dishwashing liquid to over 500 beneficiaries living in an informal settlement in Windhoek. 
5. Sylvanie Beukes alongside his partners has been developing sanitizing tools to aid in the fight of COVID-19 and future pathogenic threats to come."

The Solution:
The solution's owner thought of this project as a part of the recovery process after COVID-19. It focuses on developing rug production process in Simawa governorate, especially knowing that this city suffers from poverty, in fact more that 55% of its inhabitants suffer from poverty and that was even before COVID-19. The Rug making (Izar) is an endangered craft, and even more so after the difficult times that our country has faced. We are trying to preserve this craft, by tying it to other individuals, like the people living in the capital Baghdad, or the ones who live abroad. The project’s impact is in providing the artisans from Samawa all the raw materials, developing the Rug making process to help make production easier for them, taking the final product from these poor areas and deliver them to other individuals who are interested in reviving their cultural heritage. This way we can support the artisans, preserve our heritage and make these products available to the rest of the world. The artisans who will participate in this project, are all women from Samawa city. They come from reserved and poor families, and they have amazing skills whether it’s spinning wool, coloring it or embroidery of the Izar. This project is created with the help of Iraqi raw materials, starting from the sheep fleece and ending with the Iraqi artisans. By: Noor Hashim, young entrepreneur

Composée de matériaux très simple à 90 % locaux, cette machine est couplée à un moteur thermique consommant 2,5 litres d’essence en six heures de travail pour le traitement de 3 à 5 tonnes de tubercules de manioc épluchés. Cette machine serait en mesure d’éplucher plus de 15 tonnes de manioc en une semaine avec 4 à 5 personnes pour la manœuvre. 
Pour la même quantité, avec la méthode manuelle, il aurait fallu 25 personnes mobilisées avec tous les coûts correspondants et les risques de santé dus à l’épluchage manuel avec objet contondant. Ceci serait donc un gain en temps et une économie de coût considérable susceptible d’augmenter significativement la production de manioc et par conséquent l’amélioration des revenues des petits producteurs sans oublier l’amélioration de sécurité alimentaire dans les communautés congolaise fortement consommatrice du manioc. 
En plus du gain de productivité qu’elle apporte, son poids sied bien à une manipulation aisée dans les milieux ruraux car elle peut facilement être déplacée par 4 personnes pour des distances raisonnables dans les villages et communautés productrices. une aubaine pour les coopératives et autres institutions financières d’étoffer leur gamme de produits crédit avec destination cohérente."

Le séchage des produits agricoles permet, en allongeant la durée de vie des produits et en ouvrant la voie vers une transformation des matières premières produites, de lutter contre le problème du surplus agricole qui touche largement les producteurs nigériens. En mettant au point un séchoir qui fonctionne entièrement à l'énergie solaire, l'innovateur Saidou Madougou propose une technique innovante (aucun relais par énergie fossile n'est prévu, des batteries solaires rechargeables alimentent en continu le système de séchage), facile à utiliser, ne nécessitant pas d'autre ressource que l'énergie solaire, dont la mise à l'échelle pourrait offrir des solutions viables de transformation de leurs produits bruts aux producteurs nigériens. 
Qualifications techniques : 
Le séchoir ""SolAri"" est formé d'une boîte en tôle d'aluminium ou de zinc peint en noir.
Dimensions : 210 cm x 45 cm x 45 cm 
Capacités de séchage : une surface de 4,32 m3 de séchage, répartie en 3 chambres de séchages (6 claies chacune de 40 sur 60 cm) capable d'absorber 18 à 24 kg de produit frais. 
Alimentation : un ventilateur de 13 W est alimenté par une batterie solaire de 12V, d'une capacité de 200 Ah. La batterie est alimentée par un panneau solaire de 250 W. Un convertisseur de 500 W assure la conversion du courant continu de la batterie en courant alternatif. 
Méthode de séchage : le ventilateur atteint une vitesse de 1 à 5 m/s ; la combinaison entre la chaleur du soleil et la ventilation est l'élément central de la technique de séchage du SolAri. Le séchoir est équipé de deux thermo hygromètres, d’un analyseur d’humidité, d’un thermo anémomètre, d’une balance de précision et des outils de coupe pour mener à bien le travail. Le corps du séchoir est chauffé par la chaleur du soleil afin de favoriser l’évaporation de l’eau de l’intérieur du produit vers l’extérieur des chambres de séchage. L’air introduit par le ventilateur évacue alors cette eau sous forme de vapeur, des chambres de séchage vers l’extérieur du séchoir. L’opération unitaire de séchage sera considérée comme terminée quand la teneur en eau de l’air de séchage à l’entrée du séchoir sera proche de la teneur en eau de l’air de séchage à la sortie du séchoir. Ces deux teneurs en eau sont indiquées par les thermo hygromètres."

Face aux risques de propagation portés par la pandémie COVID-19 et la large diffusion des gestes barrières à appliquer, l'innovateur M. Saidou Madougou a mis au point une machine de lavage des mains automatique, alimentée par un panneau photovoltaïque. Elle permet un lavage de mains automatique, sans contact avec le dispositif (distribution automatique de savon et d'eau de rinçage). 
Adaptable, la solution est utilisable à la fois dans les zones urbaines (elle est connectable aux réseaux d'eau potable et d'eaux usées), mais également, en installant des bidons d'approvisionnement en eau et de recueil des eaux usées, en milieu rural (alimentée à l'énergie solaire). Elle offre donc une solution viable aux problèmes d'hygiène de base (non seulement en temps de pandémie COVID-19, mais aussi dans le cadre de la lutte contre l'ensemble des maladies contagieuses qui sévissent au Niger). 
Description de la machine : 
Elle se constitue d'un dispositif de stockage d’eau, d'un autre de solution de savon, de deux robinets (dont l'un d'eau et l'autre de solution de savon) et d’un lavabo. 
Elle fonctionne automatiquement grâce à un système de carte électronique disposant d’un microcontrôleur programmable, de deux capteurs ultrasons, d’un dispositif de commande, de trois relais électriques, d’un système de refroidissement des composants électroniques. La machine est alimentée par un panneau solaire PV, d’une batterie de stockage d'énergie électrique (autonomie de 12h) nécessaire pour le fonctionnement de la machine la nuit, d’une lampe d’éclairage du lieu durant la nuit, d’un système d’évacuation d’eau usée et de la carcasse en tôle contenant tous les éléments. 
Le dispositif de stockage d’eau est connectable au réseau d'adduction d'eau, en cas de besoin, pour le ravitailler en eau (en lieu et place des réservoirs d’eau dans la machine). Le système d’évacuation d’eau usée est aussi connectable au réseau d'évacuation des eaux usées (ou à un système de recueil des eaux usées en fonction du contexte)."

DOMAINE D’APPLICATION : Changement climatique
TYPE D’ACTIVITE : Mesure des quantités d’eau de pluie tombée
PROMOTEUR : Laboratoire LAME
CONTEXTE
Pour une bonne planification des productions agricoles aussi bien en saison sèche qu’en saison pluvieuse, il est important de connaitre la quantité d’eau tombée et celle dont on a à sa disposition pour mener ses activités agricoles. Pour ce faire, le ministère de l’agriculture et l’agence nationale de la météorologie fournissent des données pluviométriques sur la base de pluviomètres installés dans certaines localités du pays. Il faut noter que de nos jours, ces pluviomètres sont en nombre insuffisants, ne couvrent pas tout le pays et certains sont détériorés ou non accessibles en raison de la situation sécuritaire qui prévaut dans le pays. C’est donc dire qu’une bonne partie des données pluviométriques du pays ne sont pas collectées. Comment alors informer les producteurs et les décideurs sur les quantités d’eau disponibles pour la planification de leurs productions agricoles, surtout en saison sèche ? C’est pour répondre à cette question qu’est née la technologie TOP-RAINCELL. La pluie est la principale source d’apport d’eau au Burkina Faso. Et, TOP-RAINCELL permet de quantifier la pluie reçue.
PROBLEME ADRESSE
Le suivi des pluies en Afrique est une problématique majeure pour de nombreuses applications de recherche comme la modélisation hydrologique, climatique et agricole mais aussi opérationnelles telle la météorologie, les services des eaux (ONEA), la sécurité alimentaire, les alertes précoces aux inondation ou aux sécheresses, l’hydroélectricité, les routes, etc. Les méthodes traditionnelles utilisent des pluviomètres ou des radars ou encore des données satellitaires. Cependant ces différents dispositifs présentent des insuffisances : Pour ce qui est des pluviomètres, l’insuffisance porte surtout sur la capacité de couverture géographique, qui reste limitée. Pour le radar, c’est son coût qui est prohibitif pour les pays pauvres. Enfin, le suivi satellitaire et les prévisions météorologiques y relatives demeurent entachés d’incertitudes, notamment aux échelles temporelles et spatiales fines. Une méthode nouvelle, fiable et accessible, y compris aux pays pauvres d'Afrique, d'Amérique Latine et d'Asie du Sud Est, est donc la bienvenue

DESCRIPTION DE LA SOLUTION
Le Kénaf est produit dans plusieurs zones du Burkina Faso, mais les usages diffèrent d’une zone à une autre. Les différents sous-produits du Kénaf sont utilisés comme des solutions locales multiples, car ils permettent de résoudre plusieurs problèmes et de faire face à plusieurs défis dont ceux de la nutrition, de la lutte contre la pauvreté, de la protection de l’environnement, etc.
En effet, le kénaf est généralement utilisé comme une solution locale dans l’alimentation humaine et animale. Ainsi, les feuilles, les graines, les fleurs et autres résidus du Kénaf sont utilisés comme des ingrédients
ou des composants alimentaires dans les plats locaux et dans l’alimentation des animaux, surtout en période de soudure.
CARACTERES INNOVANTS
Les principales caractéristiques innovantes de cette plante sont que : i) elle pousse sur toutes sortes de sols et ses besoins en eau sont très réduits ; ii) c’est un puissant fertilisant qui pourrait remplacer efficacement l’utilisation très massive des engrais minéraux; iii) le Kénaf est une alternative très peu couteuse et accessible pour les agriculteurs dans la régénération des sols appauvris et détériorés; iv) le Kénaf en tant que matière première accélérera la production des sachets et de contenants en fibre ou papier.

a également été conçu par des jeunes élèves ingénieurs, de l’Institut Supérieur de Génie Électrique (ISGE). C’est un respirateur artificiel made in Burkina Faso, inspiré du modèle OXYgen du groupe espagnol Protyfy. Dans sa première production, le respirateur artificiel fonctionnait à l’aide de ballon auto-remplisseur à valve unidirectionnel pour simuler la fréquence respiratoire. Rappelons qu’avec la COVID-19, le respirateur artificiel est apparu en première ligne des dispositifs nécessaires à la prise en charge des personnes infectées par le
coronavirus en raison des insuffisances respiratoires liées à cette maladie. 
CARACTERE INNOVANT : Le concept en lui-même est innovant, car il vise à promouvoir le ballon auto-remplisseur en permettant à ce ballon d’être auto-activé sans l’aide ou la présence d’un agent de santé ; ce qui crée une autonomie dans le fonctionnement, facilitant ainsi le travail des agents de santé et surtout en les exposants moins au contact des malades.

d’abord, la stratégie rurale de développement communautaire (SRD) est prise en mains par la communauté, contrairement à la stratégie de développement rural de l’Etat dont la mise en œuvre est assurée par plusieurs groupes d’acteurs que ce sont : - l’Etat et ses démembrements ; - les collectivités locales et les communautés de base ; - les organisations professionnelles et les opérateurs privés ; - les partenaires techniques et financiers . La stratégie rurale de développement communautaire est conçue par rapport à un territoire défini. Elle est locale et communautaire en ce sens que la population visée forme déjà une « communauté » et ses membres sont liés par des réseaux sociaux informels. De plus, son approche territoriale est vue comme un moyen de mieux cibler les interventions destinées à relever les défis prioritaires de la zone concernée

The VUP program could not achieve poverty graduation which was the main goal of the program in the targeted poorest sectors. This raised several questions such as why there was no significant change in the lives of
beneficiaries after years of implementation, what the issues are and what could be done differently to achieve such results? The sector leadership looked into the reasons behind this challenge and realized that some VUP beneficiaries misused the financial assistance they are given under VUP program (Direct Assistance and
Public Works). The sector leadership initiated a mentorship program where a trusted mentor/coach was given to 1 or 2 households that benefits from VUP programs with the responsibility of monitoring the use of the financial
resources received under VUP. The coaches/mentors also advocate for their respective households (HHs) if need arises. So far, 174/593 households in Muko sector are beneficiaries of this mentorship program. This has increased accountability on the side of VUP beneficiaries, improved mutual understanding, friendship and trust among mentors, VUP beneficiaries and the population of Muko Sector in general. 158 mentors were chosen considering their level of education and understanding of Government Programs who went through trainings
to effectively carry out the task. This is on a voluntary basis. Coaches visit their respective HHs once a month or twice a month and coaches meet every three months to evaluate what has been done.

Le VEENIM est fabriqué à base du Jatropha curcas ; 2. le combustible écologique TIINBO. TIINBO (en mooré), veut dire Espoir ; donc un nouvel espoir dans le domaine de l’énergie domestique et industrielle en Afrique. C’est un produit à base des coques de la noix de Balanites aegyptiaca; 3. le combustible écologique KIZZI. KIZZI (en dioula), veut dire préservé ; c’est donc une nouvelle solution pour la préservation des ressources naturelles. Le combustible KIZZI est un produit écologique issu des tourteaux d’amandes de karité (Vitélaria paradoxa). 
CARACTERES INNOVANTS Le caractère innovant des combustibles se trouvent dans : 
· La transformation des résidus des produits forestiers non ligneux (tourteaux de karité, coques de balanites) en combustible pour l’énergie domestique et industrielle;
· La réduction ou l’abandon du bois de chauffe et du charbon de bois au niveau des ménages et des unités agroalimentaires;
· Le produit est promu par le Conseil régional des Hauts Bassins et porté par des communautés rurales à travers des femmes qui ont acquis la technologie de production.

Problème adressé:
Le coronavirus, détectée en décembre 2019 est une maladie qui est vite déclarée par l’Organisation Mondiale de la Santé comme une pandémie mondiale au regard par sa propagation et de ses effets sur la santé des populations. La pandémie exige des stratégies et des méthodes pour la contenir, sinon elle s’apparente à un cataclysme mondial. Ainsi, en début mars 2020 l’épidémie touche le Burkina principalement dans sa capital Ouagadougou. Un Hackathon est organisé pour detecter les solutions
technologiques et innovantes destinées à permettre au pays de mieux faire face à l’épidémie est lancé. C’est ainsi que l’ application mobile intitulée « DiagnoseMe », est propose pour le test et la gestion

Description de Wapek:
Wapek signifie « vient laver », en langue mooré parlée au Burkina Faso. Wapek est un lave
main intelligent qui peut être alimenté au solaire, mais aussi à l’énergie électrique fournie par la société nationale d’électricité du Burkina Faso (SONABEL). Si Wapek a été conçu dans l’objectif de promouvoir l’hygiène et de combattre le coronavirus, il sert aussi à la lutte contre d’autres maladies liées à l’hygiène. Ce sont entre autres la diarrhée,le choléra, la dysenterie, etc.
Caractères innovants de Wapek:• Le système de lavage autonome WAPEK permet de laver les mains sans toucher physiquement le récipient et d’éviter des nids de contamination. Il comprend un capteur qui détecte la présence d’une main et déclenche la pompe à eau permettant à la personne de laver ses mains et interrompt la sortie d’eau en l’absence de la main.
• Un autre avantage de ce dispositif est la maitrise de la quantité d’eau à utiliser. C’est une machine faite de telle sorte que l’eau soit utilisée en quantité contrôlée, ce qui permet donc de limiter le gaspillage de l’eau.
• Wapek
offre la double possibilité d’utilisation de l’énergie solaire mais aussi de l’énergie fournie par la SONABEL ;
• Wakep permet de sécher les mains avec de l’air chaud produit par un des dispositifs intégrés au produit. Wapek dispose de deux réservoirs dont l’un pour l’eau propre et l’autre pour l’eau sale qui est recueillie et qui peut être utilisée dans l’arrosage des plantes étant donné que le savon utilisé à petite quantité n’est pas corrosif

Problème adressé:
Avec la COVID-19, le lavage des mains s’est révélé primordial pour se protéger du virus. Cependant en Afrique, il est
souvent difficile de respecter ou suivre correctement les méthodes de lavage de mains comme le préconise l’OMS. En effet, une grande partie de la population et les structures de santé ne disposent pas d’outils ou d’instruments adéquats de
lavage de mains. Dans les habitudes de nombreuses communautés en Afrique, elles utilisent le même récipient (sceau, bouilloire, fût, etc.) pour se laver les mains. Ainsi, les parties de contact avec ces récipients constituent des nids
de contamination.

Sound pollution from vehicles blaring hydraulic horns is a huge problem in the streets of Dhaka, making commuting an almost traumatic experience for both pedestrians and commuters alike, whose situation is particularly exacerbated by the hours of traffic jams they have to tolerate on a daily basis. So there is a need to reduce excessive honking by frustrated drivers, who often do so habitually even when there is a red light.

I did not originally 'map' this solution. I heard about it from a former colleague of mine Gordon Jackson, who works with local communities in Baa Atoll to change the way that they manage their waste. In the month of August he sent me a video of a staff of the Baa Dharavandhoo island waste management center (also known as Eco Centro for its focus on recycling and move towards zero waste), making clips from aluminum fans dumped at the center. Since I am not currently in the Maldives - I decided to use this opportunity to find out the story behind this solution which for me is very innovative and inspiring. So I spoke to Gordon, and with his permission and blessing - got in touch with Zubair to find out the story behind this innovation. Here is the story behind this local solution: Zubair joined the Dharavandhoo Eco Centro last December. By then they had started segregating and bundling recyclables (metal, aluminum and plastic) into neat bundles - which then could be transported to Thilafushi where the plastic is taken in by Parley and the aluminum and metal taken in by Secure Bag for recycling. These bundles are held together with bands which are kept together using metal clips. Gordon and his team at Soneva used to supply the Dharavandhoo Eco Centro with these clips. With the disruptions in supply chains, they were having difficulties in getting clips. Without the clips, the Eco Centro was going into disarray, with the waste piling up in an unorganized mess in the center. Distraught, Zubair decided to try and invent his own clip. But to do this, he took one of the few remaining imported clips and realized that it was a piece of metal with a few bends. He undid the bends to get the exact measurements of the entire piece. Then he looked for waste materials that he could use to make his own clips. What he found and used are ""Usha"" brand aluminum ceiling fans. They had plenty of that at the Eco Centro. At first, the process was rather rudimentary. He used a hand cutter to cut the fan, and then a hammer to bend. Now he is working on perfecting his own clip making machine (also made from various materials sourced from the waste management center) to make the process faster. Currently, he makes about 40 clips a day. He reckons that Dharavandhoo will not have to rely on imported clips anymore. He says that if he could speed up his process, he could even supply these clips to the rest of the atoll. Photo+ Video credits: Gordon Jackson, Ali Shafeeq and Mohamed Zubair (shared with permission)

Small colorful houses have been decorating Batumi lately. having too many stray dogs roaming in the city of Batumi, local Levan Chkhaidze decided to use his savings for the construction of the houses for the strays dogs. the important aspect of the idea, was to motivate other young people in the city to take care of the street dogs and engage more people in the process. luckily the idea was a success and many were interested in cooperation or support, some were donating money, while others donated material for construction, most of the times this was a leftover from constructions and household, which could go to waste, but instead , due to the Levans idea were used for the construction of dog houses. 
The innovative approach lays not in the construction of the houses per se, but in the approach of solving the problem in the city. particularly, houses constructed by Levan were provided in the areas, where citizens would take the responsibility to engage and take care of the stray dog roaming in the neighborhood. This included vaccination, feeding, etc. 
The dog house or as Levan calls it ""hearth"" documented on the below photo was placed near the Batumi State University, where students and academic staff took responsibility to take care of two stray dogs.
Overall the interest was so big from the community, that Levan decided to create a special facebook page to engage wider public. 
Local municipalities in Georgia fail to address the problem of stray dogs roaming in the streets of the cities and towns, moreover, it is not a rare find to see malnourished, abandoned dogs wondering on the main highways and roads. The problem is created not only by the lack of stray dog population management from the local self governments, but also by the citizens. particularly, it has become ""fashionable"" to own a dog, so most of the times families purchase dogs, without realizing the full responsibility. Thus, as a result of irresponsible decision, after some time, people realize that they no longer want or are capable of having a god, so they leave the animal in the street. 
the above mentioned project engages local communities in response to the described problem, ensuring that the stray dogs are vaccinated, sterilized and bring no harm to the locals. 
this case demonstrates an example how one persons idea can engage larger community to target the common problem and to some extent take over the problem solving function of the local municipality. this case is also a good example for crowdsourcing and crowdfunding. Moreover, the fact that waste materials are being used for the construction of the dog houses creates a value for waste and a better understanding among citizens on how it can be used."

Sustainable tourism can be a viable pathway to achieve economic empowerment, particularly of informal workers of Bangladesh.

To formulate solutions to this end, the Bangladesh Accelerator Lab conducted several extended field visits to this region and in consultation with the locals, devised a portfolio of solutions to promote sustainable tourism in CHT. One key problem identified is that there is a lack of trained tour guides who can cater to the different needs of tourists. To address this, trainings could be provided to tour guides. These would include high quality training on issues such as first aid, waste management options, skill training for informal workers etc. Location specific training for specific spots could also be provided taking into context the local culture.

Mauritanians eat a lot of meat. Animals are either slaughtered at home or at a slaughter house. The hides and skins of these animals are normally left to perish which causes a lot of pollution. Since a local market for raw hides and skins hardly exists in Mauritania, some groups of people are using these hides and skins to make local traditional products. The most prominent locally produced product from hides is the “Lekshat”. Lekshat is a local traditional leather belt used by men in Mauritania to tie the Sirwal (aerated baggy pant). The “Sirwal” goes with the Moorish boubou or Drâa which is a kind of long sheet with a hole in order to let the passage of the head, with two large opened sleeves in each side. In summer time, when it is very hot, sleeves can be rolled up until shoulders. Pockets are sewed in each side to allow men to put their personal effects in. Boubou can be worn on top of a “Sirwal”. The “Lekshat” and Sirwal is a long standing traditional dress by men in Mauritania.
This helps to ameliorate situations where people have nothing meaningful to engage in within their communities, by creating opportunities through the utilization of available unwanted resources in the community such as animal hides and skins. It helps to foster a safer and more prosperous country where people are seen as active player in moving their own developmental plans forward in partnership with like-minds. It’s also, a source of livelihood and empowerment from community waste.
There is greater socio-economic potential in the hides and skins value chain that could be exploited by establishing a modern production enterprise and take advantage of the opportunity. Leather is probably the most ancient fabric used by humans, and it’s a multi-billion dollar global industry. Demand for leather goods is growing but so is criticism of its severe environmental impact, which is driving a keen interest in sustainable alternatives."

Throughout my daily route, I have come to notice the proliferate existence of small scale gas stations, or 'Pertamini' as they are called here in Indonesia, as a word play from the national energy company's name, Pertamina. These mini gas stations initially started as a collective initiative from various communities throughout Indonesia, utilizing jerry cans or reused bottles (such as those from alcoholic drinks), and are stacked in a wire rack by the side of the road, typically in remote locations. As the years go by, more modern products are developed and sold in the market, entitled 'Pertamini' or mini 'Pertamina' boxes, mimicking the large scale gas stations with their tubular storage, digital display and hose. As seen in the photos enclosed, currently there is a wide array of models available for purchase and usage, displayed in smaller roads. The main target market for these informal gas stations are mostly motorcycle riders, which travels covers to the utmost remote locations of Indonesia.
The sporadic initiative of utilizing jerry cans or used bottles in the early establishments of these small scale gas stations stemmed from the unmet need of fuel coverage for remote locations in Indonesia. As the biggest archipelago in the world, Indonesia is riddled with issues of increasing inequality, not limited to that of infrastructure and development. Thus, despite the unprecedented rate of urbanization, majority of its population still travels to remote locations to fulfill their daily necessities utilizing cars, motorcycles, and other types of vehicles. As the national energy company, Pertamina, only focuses on constructing large scale gas stations in various cities, it is challenging to cover rural areas with limited access and infrastructure. In order to further support daily activities of its population, several creative entrepreneurs started to purchase gas in jerry cans in order to include in their shops' range of products. They then gain profit from increasing the price slightly compared to that of the large gas stations and reaching the outskirts of cities. 
What started out as a seemingly scattered initiative to increase microentrepreneurs' profit, has turned into a collective movement that evolves in an accelerated pace. From employing available materials in the neighborhood, with the healthy competition among other business owners and growing need from the informal market, this particular innovation has even instigated 'proper' the importance of product design as a means to reach customers. This model has proven to be successful with the vast replication throughout Indonesia, with more developing advanced versions of the 'Pertamini' gas station. By accommodating basic mobility needs for majority of the population, this grassroot innovation has supported developments in different areas such as providing access to accessible transport systems, contributing to road safety, enabling access to school and healthcare, among others. If other communal pain points that span over the entire country's population can be identified and adeptly tackled, then the replication process could potentially occur naturally and its impact could be as in-depth as in this case study."

Panama’s health ministry published the “sanitation guide for biosecurity for the operations of in-person retail post COVID-19 in Panama” on June 4th established that all shops must ensure that the infrastructure allows for 2 meters of social distancing. In cases where this is impossible or hinders commerce (e.g. when paying for items or needing to interact on close quarters with staff/shoppers) additional protection measures or barriers must be put in place to avoid potential contagion (acrylic screens or similar). It appears that shop owners have freely interpreted the “similar”, as not all stores erected acrylic screens, but rather crafted own methods of barriers, using saran wrap, plastic films or plastic covers resembling mattress covers, and fixing these to curtain rods, soda crates, and ceiling lights, with holes cut into them to facilitate payments or handling of product.
These creations answer the need to adhere to national sanitation guidelines in an effective and low-cost manner. When asked, shop owners have commented that building these fixtures allowed them to reopen. Unless shops have put in place all sanitation requirements, they remain closed for presential business. However, availability and cost are a barrier to buying ready-made plexiglass fronts which usually function as security measures in larger shops.
As one can observe in the pictures, not only retail shop owners but also street barbers (iconic establishments in this area of Panama), individual street vendors as well as “fondas” (food stalls offering home-cooked meals) have installed these homemade biosecurity barriers in their establishments. These barriers are furthermore only one part of a chain of homemade solutions to keep their businesses alive, which include Lysol-drained foot mats in plastic pails for customers to disinfect their shoes prior to entering, homemade disinfectant constructions and proposing digital payment methods or venturing into e-commerce (please view the other solution safari outputs to learn more).

We latter learned that there are several initiatives like this one, spearheaded by the administration of the city of Skopje. Bellow is a photo illustration from one of those initiatives.
The official interpretation for this action [as suggested by the administration of the city of Skopje] is that it creates bonds between the citizens and the green spaces in the city. Moreover, the City of Skopje in the past 10 years has seen massive deforestation of the city’s green areas due to building activities. The rates are astonishing and if Skopje in the turn of the new millennium was considered a green city with 75.649 m2 green areas that have decreased today to only 18.680 m2 green areas.

In addition to that, our team’s interpretation is that: for a city where ‘green spaces’ are a scarcity this tool can also serve as a public awareness campaign about the importance of green public spaces for the sustainability of cities.

The recycling enterprise of the Gatavai Village Youths is led by its Church Minister who created the initiative to address the rising youth unemployment rate in its village. In addition, the motivation behind the social enterprise was to also cater to and assist the youth of the Gatavai village to care for their families particularly the unemployed males. The initiative produces 2 types of recycled outdoor furniture i.e. upcycled tyre outdoor furniture and natural outdoor furniture made from discarded wood/tree cuttings. The Gatavai furniture sells for $500 a set (including its tyre furniture which are all sold out) and make about $300 in profit given that most of the resources used are recycled or secondhand materials. 
Some challenges to the upscaling of this initiative includes but is not limited to the following i.e.
· Limited marketing capabilities means that the enterprise does not have a foothold in the current market share to promote its products to all of Samoa; and
· Limited time and resources of the Church Minister to conduct continuous training of its young people in the trade skills necessary to create its products.
There are about 92-95 young males involved in this social enterprise. 20 young men assist with the Gatavai Youth Recycle Enterprise. In addition to recycling and upcycling tyres, they also reuse discarded wood/tree
cuttings to construct natural outdoor furniture. The enterprise not only provide income generation and trade skills capacity building but it also contributes to mitigating climate change by promoting and preventing the
burning of tyres in the communities.
The Gatavai Village Youth Social Enterprise is an example of community cohesion and its impact on a larger scale. The enterprise is largely supported in kind by its Church Minister and Village Council and due to its primary business of collecting old and used tyres for its recycling, this has enabled its youth population to promote and push for eco-friendly land clearing practices for agricultural purposes as opposed to families burning the tyres as a method to clear land of vegetation and so forth. In addition, the enterprise has garnered support from its local mechanics and have formed partnerships where the local initiative are able to procure its tyres from the local mechanics who collect and set aside allocated quantities for the enterprise. 
Gatavai is a village located on the biggest island that comprises Samoa called Savaii. To get to Gatavai, Savaii, one must take a ferry trip across the ocean that takes about 1.5 hours. Pictured also are some of the outdoor furniture that the youths create from discarded wood/tree cuttings."

Remarks & Challenges 1 Psychological wellbeing of Females is poor. 2 Poor ventilation in the kitchen 3 There is no significant role for males (complete dependence on females) 4 5 The eldest daughter is highly expected to leave school because of her father. An early marriage is also expected. Absence of family social activities that bring male and female family members in one place and time. 
Risks: The walls and structure of the house are very weak. The building is old and any intervention to the structural elements might collapse the exterior shell and rooftop.

The problem
Solid waste is a damaging problem to a lot of countries. Malaysia faces a bigger challenge for being a dumping ground which has caused severe land and air pollution. The current waste management scenario in Malaysia looks at the increased consumption and waste generation, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, the usage of oil and petroleum which produce carbon monoxide and the waste compactor trucks also result in environmental issues due to factors such as traffic congestion, rubbish, wastewater and vehicle emissions.
The solution
Asher is a 6-metre-tall machine that can reduce most solid waste materials to ash. Waste is put into the Asher and ends up in the thermal degradation chamber where it will decompose via the pyrolysis process. The heat generated from the process is sustained only within the chamber and waste are left to dry, become brittle and eventually turns into ash. The only byproduct of Asher is odourless and neutral vapor. 
The Asher modern incinerator has 3 models- the A200S, A250ES, and A400ES which have differences in waste capacity, electric system, and the number of filters. The idea of this machine is to eliminate the waste distribution system and reduce the landfill by treating the waste at its source.
The Asher incinerator machine consists of 3 parts- loading area, electrical (fan and system), and filter & process. To start the initial burn, it requires a wood pallet to increase the heat from room temperature to 600 degrees Celsius. It takes around an hour to treat one batch (per chamber of waste ~ 0.6 m3) of waste, and the ash can be used as a soil conditioner/construction material. It requires continuous feeding of waste for ideally 16 to 18 hours for it to maintain the temperature of the Asher.
The machine is able to destroy various kinds of waste including plastics, electronic waste and rubber with the exception of glass, metals and construction materials. 
The machine is also small enough, the size of one car park, for it to be placed at a low cost residential neighborhood without it travelling to various waste stations."

Sustainable tourism can be a viable pathway to achieve economic empowerment, particularly of informal workers of Bangladesh. Cooperation between indigenous minorities and Bengalis living in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) - a major tourist destination of the country - is key to achieving this. To formulate solutions to this end, the Bangladesh Accelerator Lab conducted several extended field visits to this region and, in consultation with the locals, identified a portfolio of solutions to address the plethora of prevalent challenges and promote sustainable tourism in the CHT. One of the challenges is that local farmers in the CHT are currently not getting the just price for their produce, with agricultural products grown in very remote regions being sold at a very low price. For instance, mangoes are sold for 5-taka per kilogram whereas actual market value is around 60 taka per kg and papayas are sold for 20-taka per kg against a market value of 120 taka per kg. To address this issue, in consultation with the locals, one solution that has been identified is that if tourism is promoted in these areas, the agricultural produce can be sold at a higher value which will create additional revenue for the locals."

Objectives • Raise awareness among young people and families on the health risks posed to their communities by dumping sites, rodents and parasites. • Together with the education community, encourage the most vulnerable neighborhoods (due to this type of pollution) to trigger actions that will improve their quality of life. 
Description of citizen participation: Workshops were conducted to identify potential sanitation issues existing in participants’ neighborhoods. Based on such issues, an app was adapted, and possible preventive measures were discussed. At said workshops, the following main issues were identified: · Dumping sites · Reuse of certain materials · Compost made from organic waste Within 15 days, young people grouped in work teams sent—using the app— images showing areas of their neighborhood, mostly photos of dumping sites and rodents, which pose potential health risks to their communities. Once neighborhood mapping was completed by the work teams, workshops were conducted to discuss findings and possible management actions.

To formulate solutions to this end, the Bangladesh Accelerator Lab conducted several extended field visits to this region and, in consultation with the locals, identified a portfolio of solutions to address the plethora of prevalent challenges and promote sustainable tourism in the CHT. One of the challenges is that currently, there are very limited options for tourists in terms of places to visit in CHT.

At the beach-front craft market in Store Bay, Tobago, innovative local craftspeople skillfully convert beach waste into precious jewelry and other accessories.
This initiative satisfies several needs in alignment with the UN's SDG's. The sale of locally crafted jewelry to tourists and other beach visitors is a source of decent work and economic growth for this community. Additionally, the goal of re-using waste materials in a sustainable way is achieved through the creative use of organic and inorganic beach waste; such as bottle caps to produce earrings, calabash (local fruit that grows near the beach) husks to make purses, and necklaces made from old smoothed out glass fragments strung onto discarded fishing lines, and many other examples. 
Local crafts-people, Patsy and Thomas, are contributing to coastal preservation through sustainable innovation. Their approach of transforming waste into valuable and profitable products is an approach with global applicability. There is a growing trend towards up-cycling, with plastic bottles in southeast Asia being converted into sneakers, sargassum seaweed being used as organic fertilizers for plants, and many other examples.
Additionally, a small self sustaining economic ecosystem has bloomed around artists like Patsy and Thomas. Thomas mentioned that he purchases the components of his shark teeth necklaces from a man who visits the fish market on a weekly basis to collect discarded waste. Patsy attains components of her ""donkey-eye"" (seeds of a local fruit) chains from a man who grows and sells the fruit. Both Thomas and Patsy source some of their other products, like hand made wooden or leather purses, drink coasters, etc, from highly specialized local craftsmen. All of these items are sold at a high premium to willing tourists and sentimental locals.
This local example may be applied to other coastal communities in the Caribbean and beyond. Additionally, there are opportunities to grow and scale these businesses through the provision of alternate channels for sale of the art, such as through e-commerce sites."

The Johnny’s Young Coconuts Story
Aron Jonathan Nerahoo is a 35 year old entrepreneur from Mayaro, Trinidad. He is the founder and CEO of Johnny’s Young Coconuts, a dynamic and innovative business which is revolutionizing how the traditional
coconut is used in the culinary and festival landscape in Trinidad and Tobago.
Johnny grew up in Mayaro Trinidad, a coastal village approximately three hours away from the city centre. In Trinidad, this is as rural as it gets, and as far away from city life as possible. Every day for five years, while attending Secondary School, Johnny would pass through the Manzanilla area on mornings and afternoons, driving past 15 miles of unending coconuts trees that stretch as far as the eye can see. 
After leaving secondary school at the age of 17, Johnny worked a 9-5 making car batteries on a daily basis. He got retrenched after 9 years and wasn’t sure what his next step would be. 
One day, while at the supermarket, Johnny saw a lady struggling to lift a jar of coconut water into her cart. It was there that the idea was born! He got a flash of the miles of coconut trees in Mazanilla and thought how amazing it would be if he could bring the actual coconut, in its natural form to the supermarkets. Johnny figured out a way to brand the coconuts with his business name and started to sell the coconuts in stores and supermarkets. 
He then turned the actual coconut into a cocktail “glass” of sorts, by adding umbrellas and colourful straws and turning the coconut into an experience. Soon, he was sharing the Johnny’s Young Nuts experience in parties and carnival events. People lined up at his booth to sample the party coconut. In these events, people would come to him with their cups of alcohol from other vendors and ask him to throw the alcohol into the coconut. This was difficult to do as the hole for the straw was so small. But he tried to please his patrons. 
One day, while in in the neighbouring island of Grenada, Johnny saw two miniature alcohol bottles in his hotel room. Lightbulbs started going off and he knew that he would need to figure out a way to integrate the miniature alcohol bottle with his coconut. Without a firm plan in place, Johnny ordered bag-fulls of miniature alcohols from the United States. After trial and error, and using various innovative methods, he finally mastered the exact measurements to integrate the miniature bottles with his coconuts.
He set up meetings with the major alcohol brands in Trinidad to try to partner with them for party events and to try to break in to the multi-million dollar carnival industry. At first executives were skeptical. Here was a young man, from a remote village... what did he know about the carnival industry, or marketing and branding. The first brand that took a chance was Hennessey. After the first major carnival event, they knew
they had the next big thing on their hands. Lines snaked around the event and people were eager to sample Johnny’s Young Coconuts.
Johnny now has 27 patents for his product. This includes variations of his coconut with handles and other secrets soon to be revealed. He also innovated around the branding of the coconut itself since he had to figure out a way for the branding to stay on the nut as it is always wet. Now a company can send their logo, or a person can send their picture, and have it branded onto the coconut. Johnny and his team do all the branding themselves and invest money to the equipment that will keep them ahead of the game. They even innovated around the way to peel the coconut as if it’s an orange! He has developed a customized machine that will peel at different speeds and depths.
Johnny now travels across the Caribbean for various events including birthdays, weddings and parties. He has orders from the UK to Israel and his next steps include setting up outlets across the Caribbean and taking his product global.
Sometimes, an innovation does not answer an obvious need. Johnny was out of a job and was searching for the next thing to do. A chance encounter at a supermarket put an idea in his head that he could not let go of. He explained that people eat and drink with their eyes so he needed to come up with a way to ""reinvent"" the coconut, and to make it appealing and marketable.
The various innovations that he has established around the coconut answer the need he has to improve his product:
- a machine to peel the coconut like an orange (for branding and presentation)
- a branding method that won't wash off due to constant exposure to water and ice (to ensure that his brand is strong and lasting)
- a tool to punch different sizes of holes into the coconut (constant product enhancement)
- a flavourful mixture to give the coconut water taste an even better Caribbean ""feel"" (service-enhancement)
Lesson One: The Trinidad and Tobago carnival industry is a multi-million dollar industry that is based on costumes, music, dance and revelry. Food and drinks are a huge part of the festival landscape. However, there is a pervasive feeling that big businesses are crowding out smaller businesses and impeding their ability to compete and obtain contracts for the major events. This solution shows that with the right product, and the right innovation, barriers can be broken and even small businesses can compete in major spaces. 
Lesson Two: Partnerships are important. Johnny was able to establish partnerships with bigger brands and this allowed his business to grow faster. However it is important to note that he was already achieving success on his own without the major brands.
Lesson Three: Innovation can take place around the most unlikely subject, product or service. Once a person has a vision, or a need to be met, they can innovate around that. The interview with Johnny revealed that once he started innovating around the coconut, he could not stop. The ideas kept flowing and he now has 27 patents for something seemingly as simple as a coconut. The innovations that he keeps coming up with are all centred on different things he wants to do with the coconut:
- a machine to peel the coconut like an orange; 
- a branding method that won't wash off due to the constant water and ice that the coconut is exposed to
- a tool to punch different size holes into the coconut

A fully enclosed, indoor “farm”, controlled, soil-less agriculture in residential area. Low-cost agriculture. 
The farm is just about 180 square feet but produces 200 heads of lettuce and consists of a series of wall pipes, a coy aquarium and rows of custom-made full spectrum China-made, LED grow lights. The single room is air-conditioned and has an air purifier and to the extreme right of the room, on the far end from the entrance, there is a tall blue barrel where the water from the aquarium is purified as well (he has never had to change or replace water since first putting water in May, 2020); the purified water is fed to the plants which are seen at different stages of growth, protruding from the holes in the PVC pipes. The main product of the farm at present is Ronnie’s own variety of lettuce, which he describes as a “douglar” a Trinidadian term for a mix, because it is a cross between the US buttercrunch and a more popular local variety. For lettuces, the main product of the farm, the cycle from seed to harvest is 35 days and is estimated to have at least 18 crop cycles. Ronnie believes he can replicate that cycle for strawberries, compared to conventionally grown California strawberries where the seed-to harvest period lasts 49 to 62-days and where
there are just 3 crop cycles per year. 
According to Ronnie,the secret to the farm is the exact mix of fertiliser, which comprises treated fish faeces, sea minerals and recycled water and the carefully calibrated lighting. Each plant, he explains, requires special lighting for it to absorb the right amount of minerals and for it to grow a particular way. Prior to acquiring custom-made Chinese lights, the lettuce was limp, the way they are preferred in China.Experimenting with other lights, the lettuce was too firm and tough. Ronnie also has mature lettuce plants where he can get his seeds for new germination. Through Ronnie’s own research, he specified the kind of lighting he wants for his own lettuce, suitable for the Trinidad and Tobago customer. In one section of the farm, Ronnie is growing strawberries (there are a few young ones on the shrub), dwarf apple trees and kiwis.
The People Behind the ""Farm""
Ronnie Yearwood and his wife are Trinidadian Christian missionaries based in Guinea Bissau for 28 years. They started growing pigeon peas to make Trinidadian “pelau”, a signature dish from Trinidad. In Guinea Bissau’s fertile soils the crop flourished, to the extent that what should have been a pigeon peas shrub quickly became a pigeon peas tree. Having access to 10 acres of land in Cumuto, Trinidad, Ronnie decided to use two acres for pimento pepper cultivation, hoping to replicate his Guinea Bissau experience. But Ronnie soon discovered, that the Caribbean is not Africa. The work was arduous and labour intensive, the temperatures were often too high making irrigation pipes a necessity, soils were plagued with root-eating nematodes, and insects proved too many to beat. Yields were small both in terms of the amount given and the size of the produce. To make matters worse, Ronnie took loan from the Agricultural Development Bank for the project. While the authorities and agriculture shops recommended pesticides, Ronnie, a chemist by training, preferred to avoid the use of commercial pesticides, apart from the standard combinations of nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus (NPK) formulae. Having seen the ease of cultivation in Guinea Bissau, and the success of large-scale controlled agriculture in California, USA, Ronnie decided to study how to produce crops in a clean, pest- and pesticide-free environment, with low water and energy reliance but on a small scale. Today that project has become Beyond Organic – a small commercial farm operating out of the annex of Ronnie and Beverley’s Trinidad and Tobago home in East Trinidad. Ronnie Yearwood and Beverley, his wife, still live in Guinea Bissau but they travel home for a few months from time to time. One such visit, in October, 2019, unexpectedly extended for personal reasons and then on account of the COVID-19 pandemic, has become a year-long stay and the start of Beyond Organic, operational since May 2020. 
The entire cost of the annex, inclusive of construction, temperature regulation and irrigation, was TT$60,000. The most notable recurrent costs, according to Ronnie, is the cotton-wool cosmetic pads that he uses for germinating the seeds, costing TT$10.00 for 100 pads. Ronnie looks back and compares the new farm with the cost of the failed 2 acre project two years ago, where he would have had a loan of TT$200,000, plus extensive manual labour. If he hadn’t used inherited family land, it would have been even more expensive.
Improving the model
The Beyond Organic model has the potential to produce clean agriculture at a fraction of the cost of conventional agriculture. But Ronnie sees ways to further reduce the cost of his operation. For instance, since he is stuck here in Trinidad and Tobago, he’s plugged into the electric grid. However, he had originally wanted to use solar power. In Trinidad and Tobago, a net producer of fossil-fuel energy, commercial rates are too low to make solar generation practical. For poorer countries where energy is more expensive, he envisages solar powered fans and cooling systems. I asked him about something like a staple carbohydrate, like the hardy dry-land rice currently branded Moruga Hill rice, in Trinidad and Tobago. After all, starving
people don’t want lettuce and strawberries. “This method can be used to grow anything. You just have to do the research and experiment,” he explains. Some crops just need more space, he further elucidated, indicating that apples will need to be about 6-7 feet apart.
Ronnie’s Dream
Ronnie wants to experiment with a wider range of crops, especially those that address the cultural needs of people in West Africa. His particular dream is to continue working on the project in West Africa, which is where his heart is. He explains that this model “is not for use everywhere in Africa, or everywhere in West Africa. In some parts of West Africa there are drought conditions from October to July. If they can capture just a little bit of that water and use it effectively, they can have food all year.” One tilapia can spawn more than 10,000 fingerlings, meaning that there is a lot of fertiliser for the crops. He wants missionaries like himself to learn the model and use it to grow what the people want and need. Nevertheless, while Ronnie eyes his adopted home, Guinea Bissau, he sees the usefulness of his model for small-island countries like his native Trinidad and Tobago, where there is a high food import bill. His model, he asserts, can reduce the high food import bill of many small-island developing countries. 
Another area of focus that concerns Ronnie is “light-engineered plants”. Since light affects the plants’ uptake of nutrients, Ronnie envisages the engineering of crops using diffident intensities of light during
their growth phase, to adjust the level of particular vitamins and minerals that they contain. For example low-potassium lettuce would be suitable for consumption by dialysis patients. Confident that he already knows how to do it, Ronnie is currently looking for a laboratory where he can get the biological components of his produce tested. 
The Future
Ronnie is already selling his produce from his home. However, he wants to scale up, train others and experiment. One of the blessings of the COVID-19 is that the economic stagnation has caused some people and groups to look into alternative investments. One such group is a Christian association that runs a hotel and visitor facility. Since their facility could not be used, they have approached Ronnie to discuss giving him access to close to 2000 square feet of land. The future, though still uncertain, looks promising. 
The need for: (1) low cost agricultural production, (2) improved predictability of crop yields, (3) low water intensity. 
There is the potential for crops of special mineral intensities for special health purposes.
With planning and a relatively small investment (less than US$10K), small-scale indoor/controlled agriculture can produce a lot of clean food with low water use intensity for both subsistence and for resale. Perhaps suitable for small islands and arid regions. This should also be explored for animal alimentary needs as well."

The need to have affordable and accessible internet.
The solution is for the public. Most of the users we noticed fall under the youth sector where they use the internet to access social media sites and entertainment sites such as YouTube. Other users also expressed that they use PisoWiFi to research for school. 
The solution matters to the user because internet is expensive in the Philippines and this is their way of sharing the internet to others. This is basically a basic form of the sharing economy. This also means that internet access is something that people have been looking for.
The solution has gained traction among the public and business is observed to be brisk. With an investment of Php20,000, one can set up their own PisoWiFi in their homes allowing them to share and monetize their internet to their neighbors who can't afford.

The strategies to beat effects of African Swine Fever (ASF) to the pork vendor was remarkable. Theresa Blanco resorts to the following strategies to compensate income losses due to ASF. These include: business diversification, reducing input cost (labor) and sticking to policies or laws related to meet quality output.
Other pork vendor may benchmark on the coping mechanisms and strategies and also government support.

Cacao merits much economic significance in the producing Region like the Davao Region. Considering all these benefits of cacao, cacao production and processing needs to be mechanized and properly improved to aid profits and reduce losses. Hence, the development of this concept of designing of an electric cacao pod breaker machine. The electric cacao pod breaker which crushes the pod. The breaker includes an agitator that starts the process of separating the beans from the husk. Cacao bean pulpers agitate the material and further separate beans
from husk. Beans drop through grated pulper floor. The machine appears to use standard electric motors and switching equipment. Claims to be able to break different sizes of pods. Breaking rather than cutting makes this possible. Low waste and probably less than 5%.
Efficiency and minimize wastage
Cacao farmers and cacao processors
Alternative affordable way to process cacao efficiently with minimum wastage.
It can be commercialized to cacao farmers to improve their production efficiency and increase profit.

Coal Stove with Electric Blower - a prototype coal blower with an electric blower as accessory. The operator does not need to monitor and have continues blowing since the accessory does the trick. 
It serves as a solution to the unending monitoring and blowing of stove. It also serves as an answer to the burning inefficiency of the coal.
It will be used by cooks in restaurants, carenderias, and even homes. It will give ease to the operator and makes cooking more easier, less hassle. It is significant since it will improve kitchen operation.
Typical equipment which can be seen in homes and firms can be improved more by innovation. These equipment can be modified through changing the design or adding more accessories to improve its function. 
The prototype can be replicated and adapted by other communities and business firms who are in the food sector, this can be used to improve efficiency and operations and also for those who wish to improve their kitchen errands.

In response to the national, even worldwide, call for control/prevention of the spread COVID19 pandemic, the DOSCST prepared a Foot Bath made of coco coir, which is an indigenous material readily available in the locality. The coir is sprayed with a chemical as disinfectant. This is placed at the entrance Gate that will disinfect the shoes/wheels of anyone (persons) or anything (vehicles) entering the school premises.
This solution (Coco coir foot bath) answers the challenge to immediately support the prevention if not eradication of the virus spread at a very minimal cost as much as possible. There no need for constant refilling of the chemical because the coir is capable of holding the solution for quite a long time.
This is for the faculty, staff, students, and guests entering the school premises. This solution is user-friendly because of the capacity of the coco coir to hold the water intact while giving just enough disinfection needed for both humans and vehicles. This means lesser hassle to the users - no shoes are overly immersed in the disinfectant, thus avoiding wet sandals or feet without jeopardizing the OOTD (outfit-of-the-day/footwear) of the user. 
I found this solution worth-emulating because it is both cost efficient and user-freindly. It is wise to use indigenous materials that can be friendly to nature as well.
This solution can also be applied not only in the academe but also in other institutions: supermarkets, wet markets, hospitals, and other public places.

Amaranthus, or locally known as ""kulitis"" is basically regarded as backyard weed- endemic in the province and even in other places. It just grows anywhere, hence,it usually is uprooted or mowed. Despite its quite misunderstood identity, especially to those who know less or nothing about it, there is more to ""kulitis"" than what meets the eye.
To some, especially to the elders, it is a potential source of food. It's tops/tips are harvested, and are prepared as one of the viands by means of sauteing. In the far flung areas, or to those who cannot always afford to buy themselves sumptuous foods, this edible backyard weed is more than enough to make through the day without an empty stomach.
It is very beneficial for those who are living in far flung areas, as well as those who cannot always afford to buy food.
Even the grass or weeds that seem to be pestering around the backyard or our vacant lots, bring about the saving graces to every stomach.
Various households, especially those of the financially challenged, as well as a supplement to nutrition needs.

The doormat is made of 100% pure coconut coir, which is one of the strongest natural fibers in the world. The material easily captures moisture, dirt, and other particles. Due to the way our coir mats are cut, sizing may show slight variations. Light shedding may naturally occur when unrolling coir mats out of the package the first time.
Coconut coir is naturally resistant to bacteria and fungi, making this the most low-maintenance doormat possible. It is also water-resistant, and will dry quickly so you won’t need to worry about mildew or moldy messes. Simply shake it out or vacuum it once in a while, and let the coir do the rest. The rug is designed specifically for both indoor and outdoor use, making it ideal for any room or entryway in your home. Built to last, the durable material will withstand whatever weather or conditions come its way.

Starting April 2019, the Baku Metro has introduced “accessible subway” service to make subway system accessible for the people with disabilities including people with low vision, people who are hard of hearing, elderly, pregnant women with hand luggage. The user can request the service via phone or app by naming their location and a final destination one hour in advance of taking the ride. The trained staff meet them at the designated location in front of the subway and take to the intended place. During the process they use alternative escalator (in most cases, there are three escalators in the subway) and place a person in the first train. The service operates between 9 am and 9 pm, but the subway administration does not recommend passengers to use it during the peak hours. It is important to note that the subway staff who work for these services undertakes special training sessions on how to work with the end users. The subway administration receives around 35 calls per week, but they have a capacity to handle more requests. As per January 2020, they are planning to grow and build assistive infrastructure in the subway. The system was designed based on the experience similar system in Moscow and London.
Talking about the reconstruction, it is hard to make infrastructure in the subway stations built during the Soviet Union. In fact, based on the past instructions, people with disabilities should not be allowed to go in the subway. Considering the costs and feasibility, the subway administration could not renovate old subway stations to make them accessible. However, the administration is looking towards new stations in the new purple line to be fully accessible with elevators and other amenities."

Intro
Different stakeholders have been engaged in the collecting, sorting, recycling of the waste in large cities in Azerbaijan, and, noticeably, the collection chain has been managed by the public services while sorting, and recycling has been done haphazardly by individuals and/or small-medium enterprises. It creates a hidden system of plastic recycling in the country, which is, on the other side, a shadow solution to plastic pollution that has evolved organically on the grassroots level. To understand the entire cycle, Acclab has made several field visits and met the representatives at all stages.
Stats
Plastic waste, which is around 6% of the entire waste in Azerbaijan, causes significant environmental threats. According to the State Statistical Committee, the volume of household waste is 907. 3 ths m3 in the country and 204.8 ths m3 in Baku in 2018. However, the independent assessments show that the number of produced waste is much higher than that reported. To illustrate, it has been calculated that the amount of household waste is about 1684.1 ths m3, and the amount of waste per person is around 333 kg per year. In this regard, it is estimated that approximately 20-24 kg of plastic waste per year accounts per citizen in Azerbaijan.
Although the harmfulness of plastic waste has been recognized, in recent years the production and usage of plastic have increased significantly in the country. As evidence, the production of plastic has been doubled, and the import of plastic bags has increased five times. The amount of secondary polymer has risen by 700% between 2015 and 2018. 
Situation
Except for Baku, the collection of the waste is organized by the Cleaning Department of the Regional Executive Authorities. In the large cities except for Baku, there is no formal waste sorting process, and it has been sorted manually
by individuals across the city and in the landfill. Around 100 people are sorting waste in the city, and 30-40 people are doing it on the polygon. They are mostly looking for, so-called mild plastic, and don't collect PET plastic, which is used to make bottles for carbonated soft drinks. A number of small and medium enterprises are purchasing politelen or other types of plastic except for PET plastic and reuse it for secondary production. 
This is the case of a grassroots solution to the problem, which has been solved by the community naturally."

This local start-up was found in Luang Prabang in the northern part of Lao PDR. It is not a novel innovation in the world, but it is new to be produced and used in the country. The idea was introduced by the Indian tourists who visited the park which aimed to become environmentally friendly. At first, they planned to ban the use of plastic containers in their activity park, but it has received high interests for businesses in tourism sector. 
Issue they want to solve: 
Leaf plates and containers are optimal alternative plastic and polymer-based products. Most bamboo, palm, and areca sheaths are abandoned or burned everywhere. Therefore, the local villagers are encouraged to collect and sell these sheaths to exchange for some income.
Potential expansion: 
There is a possibility to produce machines with different moles in Lao PDR by collaborating with Faculty of Engineering, Technical Vocational Colleges. The initiative can turn into Sustainable Business Model by generating income in the community and creating jobs by forming a group or cooperative. It can be connected with other development projects in country and the region which support the production of rattan and bamboo and livelihoods for income generation scattering across the countries by government and NGOs."

Problem Statement: 
Due to the drastic increase in Covid19 cases Georgian government and medical sector failed to provide adequate services for all who are in need, the 112 emergency services sometimes takes few attempts to reach the operators, when requested an ambulance it take 4-5 hours for an ambulance to reach the patient. additionally, those undergoing the treatment at Covid Hotels and at home are assigned with general practitioner who is supposed to check on the patients on a daily basis, however due to the volume of infected, it becomes challenging to reach every patient for advice on treatment and procedures. Thus many remain uninformed on basic treatment procedures to tackle Covid19. 
Solution: 
In order to provide peer to peer support and inform everyone in need, one of the medical staff representatives in Adjara region of Georgia created an informal group on social media, where people who are either Covid infected and or know someone who is infected become members of the group. the group has already almost 13000 members. the purpose of the group is to provide support to those infected, share experience from those who have already recovered from the Covid, share information on the situations in different hospitals (from those who are undergoing the treatment) and share contact information of DPs who are volunteering to provide phone call advice to the Covid Patients. with this simple solution, citizens are supporting each other through hard times, since the medical sector is failing to provide adequate services and attention to all who are in need."

I visited Milyanfan village, 20 minutes from Bishkek, capital of Kyrgyzstan. As there is no centralized infrastructure, each family decides on how to heat their house. Because of the high electricity cost, most people use coal for this purpose which is the determinant of extremely bad air quality in Bishkek. In one of the houses I saw an interesting furnace which is the core of the heating system of the house. It was made by the owner of the house. As he said, they bought this house just a year ago and last year he was notifying that they spent too much on coal, moreover it took a lot of efforts for him and his family members to look after the furnace and add coal every 40-45 minutes to maintain certain temperature. Moreover, they also had to pick all the ash with their hands, otherwise the furnace might become clogged very shortly. 
So, with his engineer background, he created a new furnace where you can open the top, put coals in three buckets from which the needed amount of coal automatically goes to the fire; it is enough for 12-14 hours, meaning you need to put coal only twice a day, not every 40 minutes. It is very efficient for maintaining the temperature, as if you miss your time to put coal in the traditional furnace, the home temperature goes lower immediately and you need to spend more coal to warm up the system - > more air pollution & more expenses. Furthermore the ash is also collected in a separate part of the furnace, which they further use as natural fertilizer.
Recently he installed thermostat into the system - so it is already a semiautomated heating system. The inventor also mentioned, that all his neighbors are interested in this approach and ask him either explain the technology or ready to pay him for his help. Thus, he has become a positive deviant in the village (what he does not know yet =) ). Unfortunately, I was not able to take photos of the internal parts as the furnace was on the working mode."

In the store, I got curious when I saw the plastic bucket with many colorful rubber bands around it. I was intrigued where they were coming from and what purpose they served in the meat section. I talked to the two ladies at the counter who shared that they [sales people] usually receive plastic bags with one rubber band around it to keep the bags together. This one lady collects the rubber bands instead of discarding them and uses them for various purposes. For example, she said rubber bands help calculators to stick their together when they get old and about to break. Another purpose she shared with me was using the plastic bands to bind cash, which is a more common usage. 
This solution does not answer a particular need, however, it shows creativity to use every day items, such as rubber bands. 
The lesson for me was that people can find different ways to use a simple thing like a rubber band. Even though it was not a primary object (i.e. it came as a 'package' for plastic bags), some sales people saved rubber bands for future use sometimes not even knowing what they would need them for. 
Once I saw these rubber bands and talked to the women who were saving them, I started noticing that quite a few sales people have similar pattern of behavior - saving rubber bands and using them differently. When I talked to multiple (four) people saying it is cool to see how they use the bands, women were smiling mentioning that this is a usual thing and there is nothing special about it. This shows how people often take these small acts of 'innovation' for granted even though someone actually had to come up with it."

In my neighborhood municipal administration arranged temporary market place and allowed local farmers and small producers to sell their products for citizens of the city during weekends. Walking by rows of trading places, I was thinking if I can find something which is worth the grassroot innovation name. It was a last row and I said myself ""Where I should go next to find the innovations?"", and immediately I faced with farmer selling his vegetables in interesting boxes. Bingo! I greeted him ""Salam aleykum!"" and he answered ""Waleykum assalam!"". 
After traditional greetings I asked his permission to interview him and make some photos. Bakhadyr baike (brother in Kyrgyz language) told his story. His name is Bakhadyr and he lives in Sretenka village in 45 kilometers from Bishkek city. Twenty years ago Bakhadyr with his wife decided to immigrate from the South of Kyrgyzstan to neighborhood of Bishkek for 'better live'. Now they have a daughter and a son. His family has a small land (plant is 50 ares) where they grow potatoes, bell pepper, pumpkin and other vegetables. 
Bakhadyr told that last three weeks were very cold in Bishkek (up to minus 12 degrees!), so it was hard to keep vegetables (especially, perishable ones) in good condition. Many traders in the streets challenged with high risk to lose their goods and save the only source of income. Bakhadyr was thinking how to sustain his 'green' worth. One day he decided to construct 'thermos' for keeping temperature warmer than outside. He drawn a design of box, took 2 insulation lists (left after repair works) and scotch tape. After several manipulations two new and promising boxes were ready to use.
Testing was very successful, and it is amazing that fresh bell pumpkins stay 'tradable'. In order to increase temperature in thermo-box, from time to time Bakhadyr lights a candle inside.
By the way, Bakhadyr said that he has another grassroot innovations in his household, and I hope that I will have a chance to discover new innovations and share new stories how ordinary people solve daily challenges."

All the purchased equipment complies with the requirements of the legislation of the Republic of Belarus on the uniformity of measurements (equipment is indicated in the State Register of Measuring Instruments and verified). In addition to monitoring equipment, “green schools” received equipment to visualize the results of observations.
The monitoring toolkit includes both equipment for measuring air quality and other environmental components, and this electronic platform for collecting and processing monitoring data. An element of the electronic platform is an electronic diary of environmental observations available to users registered on the site (with a username and password).
The electronic platform is integrated into the NSMOS system and is supported by Belhydromet. Access to entering data on the electronic platform and its receipt is provided both from personal computers and mobile devices (smartphones and tablets), for which a link to download the application for Android is located on the main page. Monitoring data is available to a wide range of users through the Internet on this site, and club members and students of ""green schools"" act as suppliers of monitoring information, participating in monitoring events.
Monitoring data is available to a wide range of users through the Internet on this site, and club members and students of ""green schools"" act as suppliers of monitoring information, participating in monitoring events.
For training in the use of equipment, a Guide on the use of equipment for monitoring atmospheric air for “green schools” was developed, published, sent to “green schools” and resource centers that received monitoring equipment and posted on this site (in Russian).
The environmental monitoring platform integrates weather stations operating on the basis of ""green schools"" and weather stations of Belhydromet into a single network.
Meteorological parameters from weather stations of “green schools” are entered and stored in the section “Data of green schools”. Belhydromet weather stations transmit their data to the platform and this data are stored in the menu item “Data of the Hydromet” information that is collected by the “green schools” is also exported to the Hydromet using this platform for further work.
The geographical coverage of the green school eco-monitoring system covers 18 points. This network covers the whole Republic of Belarus.
The geographical coverage of Belhydromet consists of 53 automatic weather stations that transmit parameters to Belhydromet, and which are also displayed in this electronic platform.
All Internet users can see and download publicly available data in the ""Green Schools Data"" section - ""Green Schools - Base of All Observations Validated by Belhydromet."" This is the basis of all observations validated by Belhydromet. This menu item includes the data that Belhydromet has decided to publish.
My name is Dr. Piotr Sachek (piotr.sachek@undp.org). Under my supervision and general management this platform was created, the 18 points tha are situated on the basis of Green Schools were trained in using it, and now I'm responsible for functioning of this platform and data transferring from Green Schools to Belhydromet (State Hydrometeorogical Service) and vice versa. The parameters of CO2 emmision, weather data, etc. can be used by civil society to predict emergency situations."

Many elderly people go there every year. But it was inconvenient for people to go hiking around these 5 ha of specially protected nature area, where the usage of transport with internal combustion engines is prohibited.
So, the Victor Rovba proposed to organize the internal logistics in the park with the use of motorless and e-transport.
For the groups of 7-10 people with elderly ones the electric bus was purchased.
For the small groups of 2-4 people where there are younger people - the velomobiles were purchased,
For the families or pairs - bicycles and hyroscooters were purchased.
All these helped to speed up the tourist flow, and now Nesvizh park can accept 4 times more tourists than before. The revenue also increased, surely. 
The e-bus is widely used to transport weddings. The e-bus was adapted to the climate of Belarus by producing doors and installation of Webasto heater. This allowed to widen it's use during the year and use it until the temperature is upper than +7 degrees Celsium (from early April up to November)"

Walking around my locality, I observed that the trees of the taxi stand had been preserved and made into benches by the taxi drivers instead of being cut (like so many other taxi stands over the island). They wanted to preserve the environment and hence have transformed the trees into some sitting space as well as shade providers as they work through the day, especially during the hot summers over the island. Just a small note, there was also an area within the trees that they had transformed into a prayer spot for their work.
Dry, heavy sunshine and droughts are affecting so many areas of the island. Trees are cut for development and most of the time no new trees are planted. Therefore this observation of preservation of trees throughout development and enhancement of the locality is the perfect example that sustainable development of the locality, cleaner environment for the taxi drivers as well as the preservation of trees for shade making and sitting area can work together.
Development is possible, through the most sustainable way. Trees do not need to be cut down for development or settlement.

The production was established within the UNDP project ""Supporting the Transition to a Green Economy in the Republic of Belarus"".
Establishment of this production led to the creation of the conditions for the transition from the use of environmentally unsafe coolants based on ethylene glycol polluting the soil to a low-risk analogue produced in Belarus; it is based on glycerol, a substance widely used even in the cosmetics industry as safe in small quantities and not polluting the soil.
To avoid engine overheating, vehicle manufacturers recommend changing the coolant every 45-50 thousand kilometers.
Capacity - about 1000 tons of antifreeze per year (up to 5% of the Belarusian market capacity).
Emissions - 0.3 tons of substances into the air per year (filter installed).
The samples of the new product “Antifreeze ECO-100” underwent laboratory tests in RUE “Scientific and Practical Center for Hygiene”. The distinctive feature of the product is that with its properties it may replace the more expensive imported hazardous analogues of the 1st and 2nd classes, while the disposal of this product would cost enterprises with vehicle fleets a lot cheaper.
Implementation of the pilot initiative made it possible to create conditions for gradual replacement in the Republic of Belarus of up to 5% of the annually consumed volume of the existing coolants to an environmentally friendly analogue produced in Belarus and to access the markets of the Eurasian Economic Community (the volume of coolants consumed in the Republic of Belarus is about 13,000 tons per year).

In my childhood village, I observed swathes of blue in almost every backyard. They turned out to be mini vegetable gardens being cultivated in old shipping drums, which people started when COVID-19 began to impact Barbados. I spoke with Angela, who said she's been planting everything from eggplants to beans to lettuce to herbs -- out of necessity and as part of their efforts to stay active during the lockdown. She and her neighbors are doing it all organically, without chemicals. In addition, the community is recycling the water drums and experimenting with rainwater harvesting, instead of irrigating with water from the country's stressed water supply system.
Barbados is a country heavily dependent on food imports -- and faced the harsh reality of a dwindling food supply at the height of the pandemic. In addition, it is classified as a water-scarce country, an issue that climate change has exacerbated. This solution encourages sustainable community agriculture where land space is limited but the need for food and nutrition is high. It addresses multiple needs for food, water conservation, and income.
There are many lessons to be learned. Here are some of them:
1. When communities work together to solve a common problem, there can be viable solutions.
2. Start where you are, use what you have -- in their small backyards, with recycled shipping barrels/drums, and homemade agriculture solutions, this community is saving money, saving water, and eating well.
3. Be willing to experiment. -- Not every vegetable they've tried has succeeded. The okras didn't work out well, neither did some of the herbs but that hasn't deterred them."

Every day, between 6:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. in winter, Casavalle has low voltage. If you want to plug something in, the thermal keys get off. This is because there are many people who are hanging from the electric lines.

Even garbage trucks often do not pass because the cables are low, and that is because people hang from the line. It is a vicious cycle of poverty.

5 teenagers from Casavalle (a very low-income neighborhood in Montevideo) decided to create something that could help everyone. They created a heating system using wind energy with materials that are easily accessible. Fan propellers, washing machine pumps and fire bricks. The energy comes from the wind that makes the fan blades spin rapidly; behind the paddles the washing machine pump is connected. This washing machine pump can be removed from any that is in disuse. A cable is connected from the pump that transmits the energy to a shielded resistance (it is found inside the electric jugs). Finally, the resistance is embedded within a firebrick.
The idea is that the brick is part of the structure of the house and that all this installation goes outside the houses, because today there is a risk in precarious houses that the resistances above the bricks set everything on fire.

Whit this brick, the house can be heat in a very cheap way and accessible.

2-People hanging from the electric lines.
3- Garbage trucks often do not pass

To introduce you to this innovation, I have to gave you a bit of background information.
Trishaw is a common neighbourhood transportation in Yangon, Myanmar. When you want to go to the market and carry a load of groceries, trishaw is always a first option for the city dwellers. And, Yangon never allowed motorbikes due to a controversial policy under the military regime, which has not changed under two terms of civilian government. However, under the difficult circumstances of Covid-19 restricitions, motorbikes came into picture with new form, bikeshaw!
A traditional trishaw is a tricycle, a bicycle with a carriage attached to it, but this new motorbike trishaw (which I named as bikeshaw :D ) attached a carriage to a motorbike. Those of you who know tuk tuk would wonder, what's the difference? Then, I would have to say this is Yangon's new interpretation of tuk tuk. :)
Check out the comparison of traditional trishaw and the modified bikeshaw in the below picture.
These bikeshaws mostly serve as mobile shops during Covid 19. When people are reluctant to go out to buy their daily needs, these bikeshaws fulfil these needs by transporting the local vendors in front of your house. Instead of tedious peddling of trishaw, the bikeshaw drivers easily carry the goods and sell around or carry both a street vendor and the goods on their bikeshaws. My mornings would start with the recorded voices of these local vendors playing from their bikeshaws selling raw meat and fishes to fresh coconuts. The convenience of these bikeshaws expand the coverage of the local vendors who would usually use trishaws or carts. In return, it increases their sales and empowering them their businesses running during this difficult time of Covid-19.
Need is one of the main driver for innovation.
These bikeshaws are still in question for legality, but these serve the purpose for the people already and it would be difficult for the government to neglect it. I believe that these bikeshaws would change the policy on bikes by the local government of Yangon. Sometimes, needs prevail the rules.
While the potentials of these bikeshaws such as in the delivery services limited by utilising bicycles because motorbikes are illegals, and in solving traffic congestion, we also need to foresee the potentials of third order negative consequences."

The Future of Climate in Iraq Exhibition is an art exhibition that invites new players in the community to think about the future, grasp the aspiration of the Iraqi community in response to climate change challenges and share their own perception of the climate they want to see in Iraq in the long-term using visual art. This participatory future approach will invite people to avoid short-termism and think in the long-term as well as engage the public through creating the purpose to start impacting decision-making and identifying local solutions that are aligned with the local community priorities. This exhibition aims to build the capacities of the Iraqi local community to think long-term and participate in drawing the future they want, and throughout the whole process unite people, give them hope, and a shared identity about the future they want. Goals: The sensing initiatives aim to engage people through online submissions to scan, sense, explore and forecast the future of climate and mainly: - Change the way of thinking of the Iraqi local community to think long-term and participate in drawing the future they want through art. - Engaging more people and new players in thinking about the future will lead to startups that satisfy market needs and better decision making. The initiative does not target only experts and decision-makers but target the local Iraqi community in order to avoid cognitive bias and groupthink. - The future thinking participatory approach helps the implementers of the initiative to: - Show “blind spots” that are not included in our research. - Harness collective intelligence of the future - Analyze change in a specific issue over time - Spur ideas and knowledge that help in drawing out potential futures and achieve that through promoting collective actions in the present. - This approach will engage citizens in long-term thinking about climate change and inform the Accelerator Lab and partners next steps when analyzing the challenges and drawing the portfolio of solutions. - Imagining the future solutions for the climate challenges in order to help the implementers to direct and dig deep to shape the current solutions to match the future needs. - Supporting the UNDP Environment Energy and Climate Change pillar (EECC) and the partners to have another point of view from the community level to tackle the challenges by bringing the community priorities on the table. - Brining new players to have a voice; minds in the margins are not marginal minds! Giving the voice to artists. - Using unusual and new data sources and analysis to provide input for UNDP and partners. - Identifying the prioritizes of the local communities in order to support in building local solutions, startups, around them.

Sustainable tourism can be a viable pathway to achieve economic empowerment, particularly of informal workers of Bangladesh. Cooperation between indigenous minorities and Bengalis living in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) - a major tourist destination of the country - is key to achieving this. To formulate solutions to this end, the Bangladesh Accelerator Lab conducted several extended field visits to this region and, in consultation with the locals, identified a portfolio of solutions to address the plethora of prevalent challenges and promote sustainable tourism in the CHT. One of the challenges is that tourists often lack information on the history of the specific places within the CHT region. To address this issue, one solution that has been identified in consultation with the locals is that the history of the tourist spots should be documented very clearly, consulting relevant literature, and some experts with relevant knowledge should be employed to do so. This can help increase interest among tourists, particularly those interested in travel, and also make them more mindful about maintaining the integrity of the places they are visiting."

At Ulu Gumum Indigenous Village in Pahang, Malaysia, the villagers are stricken by poverty and low income, have diminished natural resources and access to clean water, poor housing and roads, and poor access to health and education. Despite these, the community shows interest in farming where the Foundation for Community Studies and Development's (YKPM) came and supported them to provide a source of stable income and limiting the needs to clear the forest for cash crops. The solutions: Community Farm Enterprise was introduced to the local villagers of indigenous people to encourage organic farming. The initiative started with 8 farmers after months of preparation and has increased to more than 50 farmers at present. The farmers planted over 30 types of vegetables such as bottle gourds, eggplants. tomatoes, long beans, corn, Brazilian spinach and okra. After five years since the project started, major supermarket franchise Jaya Grocer became a marketplace for the farm produce to be sold under their own brand, OA Organik. Progress: A dedicated team for compost making was initiated as more produce are being grown while keeping the price affordable for all the farmers. At the same time, the community is able to build a stronger organization in managing quality control, packing produces, procurement of seeds, maintenance for irrigation and equipment and bookkeeping. Impact: Since the project started, the local villagers are able to purchase their own seeds and farming equipment after earning up to four times their previous total income. They have also purchased washing machines, cars, motorbikes and expanded their house to live more comfortably. With funding support, management workshops and farm training are able to take place for the local communities to get hands-on training and coaching. The success of this initiative for the indigenous people to improve their livelihood has allowed replication of the farming practices to other villages. OA Organik also hopes to build an integrated farm with fruits, vegetables and farm animals while practising compost making from recycled materials and farm waste."

Through their project, “Empowering Orang Asli Jakun in Johor and Iban Communities in Sarawak towards Environmental Stewardship”, it empowers local communities via conservation education towards the survival of endangered animal species. The project focuses on the site's importance for remnant orangutan populations, elephants and tigers. Solutions: 1. Connects communities with agencies for patrolling efforts by implementing an effective first line surveillance on the ground. -A Siren fence system was introduced to solve Human-Elephant conflict. An early warning system will alarm the farmers when elephants try to enter their crop fields, reducing crop-raiding problems. The siren fence consists of a thin, horizontal steel wire supported by wooden poles along the perimeter of the crop field. The alarm kit consists of a switch, car siren and 12 volt dry-lead acid battery attached to the wire which will trigger the siren when elephants come in touch with it. Local communities are also able to operate GPS devices, satellite phones and digital cameras on their own though patrolling training. Allowances are given to participating patrols. 
2. Pilot Eco-tourism program - The eco-tourism program is a community-based eco-host project through nature education. To ensure the program runs smoothly and materials as well as seminars can be conducted online, they introduced an Internet booster initiative that will help the community to participate. The success of this tourism plan will allow replication on other sites and promoting tourism at indigenous village sites. 3. Publishment of a folklore book entitled ‘Wildlife Tales and Iban Myths from Sabah and Gunung Lesong’ - The book consists of 21 folklore stories originally in Iban language and are translated into English language. As of now, 200 copies of books are ready for distribution. 4.

In Africa, about 18 million people are displaced and globally, 821 million people are undernourished, and depend mostly on aid/grants from government and non-governmental agencies to survive. Leveraging a growing network of vendors, government agencies, non-governmental organizations, development agencies and philanthropists are able to administer aid/grants to their intended beneficiaries conveniently without the risks and high costs associated with typical processes of aid delivery. As a lot of vulnerable populations do not engage in the formal economy and might not have bank accounts to receive aid especially cash programmes, Aid Card meets them where they are and provides them a way to receive aid when needed. Aid-givers can also track and see how distributed aid/grant is expended by their beneficiaries in Realtime.

Collective View is a citizen science project that seeks to complement traditional monitoring techniques, supporting validation points that allow Satellite Remote Sensing to improve its levels of precision.
The project has been developed by researchers from the Department of Observation and Study of the Earth, the Atmosphere and the Ocean of El Colegio de la Frontera Sur (ECOSUR), Chetumal unit, based on a collaborative scheme for the capture of images, algorithms of artificial intelligence for the automatic classification of photographs and geographic information systems for the visualization of results.
The main objective of the project is to generate distribution maps of sargassum along the beaches, using images collected and sent by the society. Through the use of an application available for mobile devices, the citizen can send images of the beach conditions. This information is stored on cloud servers and, later, the images are classified and processed so that various products can be produced, such as, for example, statistics of citizen participation by region or distribution maps of sargassum along the beach. , which in turn can support decision-making.

It is true that for my age it can seem difficult to reconcile but as we can well mean it, the work ennobled and makes it possible to avoid certain derogatory situations especially for us of which most of the families have modest incomes. Here is in a few lines my experience in this battery recharging business.
Being a member of a modest family, I must always help my parents find a way that can be a relief for them with regard to the expenses related to the maintenance of my brothers and me. Thus, I hurry every afternoon to reach the port of Kamsar where the population is quite dynamic and made up of saleswomen, fish fishermen but also resourceful people like me. I run a battery recharging business there that serves as a safe haven for the phones of the above types of people.
To avoid the theft and / or loss of phones, I use a ticket coupling system, each with the number corresponding to that provided by the carrier of the phone. during the collection, he has the obligation to present it to me with the cost of the service, against which I deliver the telephone.

On the principles to look and try to find what best we can identify as innovation, we have been running our safari around Touyah beach. In normal situation it is a kind of waste dropping zone but according to what I had in front was really surprising. Because of the fact that we found the area that was before considered as nasty by the tones of collected wastes from the direct deposit of men and also all the raining water that was leading the wastes through the water coming from the area sides all around; clean with new restaurants at both sides of the road.
By discussing, we have seen from something like 300m a kind of rounded base all around flowers and my collegue and I have decided to just try to be closer and bingo! ""Funny!!! are these guys, has said my collegue.""
for the first point of view this was for us a joke. How can he be using tires as flowerpots? 
Some 10 to 15m later, we come to realize by seeing the complete line of tires that was used to change the state of the area. For the Owner, ""this was for me a solution to avoid two cases: 
1- Fight against Air pollution as we cannot burn or incinarate without smoke!
2- Be submerged by falty tires and not be able to do something against, would certainly lead to the degradation and pollution of the environnement.""
So please if you have faulty tires and you realy do not have idea for avoiding the incinaration please give a look at this solution and just let us know how it helps to transform things around you!

Raed Khader, architect from the city of Madaba, has an idea for a mobile handicraft training center ( a van) that teaches handicrafts around Jordan. This is in prototype phase. He also has a workplan and presented an analysis to justify his idea. His brief description about the idea: In addition to being one of the most beautiful manifestations of heritage, as well as being a cultural heritage, and an area for innovation, It is an activity that contributes to: Improving income, raising the standard of living, and providing job opportunities; It is a source for developing economic resources, and one of the important factors for reviving the commercial and tourism movement. However, craftsmen in Jordan face some of the problems and challenges that have led the current generations to move away from them, which made me feel responsible for being an architect following the path of Hassan Fathi, the Egyptian architect known as the poor architect, to devote himself to studying problems and solutions and strive to solve them and revive our Jordanian heritage and culture. It is worth noting that the mosaic craft was the reason the Governorate of Madaba was added to an international network of creative cities around the world by UNESCO in 2017, and we also gained the title of the city of stone mosaics in 2016 by the International Crafts Council Problems and challenges facing the handicraft sector: Lack of coordination in the sector Product development and development Getting to the market Production Quality control The lack of a Jordanian identity The regulatory framework Competing interest in work lack of English competency for many that work in the sector"

Les plantes établies par cette technique développent un système racinaire très épanoui, ce qui leur permet de résister aux sécheresses. La pratique peut s'utiliser à partir de l'isohyète de 150 mm jusqu'à celle de 600 mm, voir même au-delà. Dans les zones les plus arides, une quinzaine d'espèces indigènes peuvent être établies par cette technique, et dans les zones plus humides, plus d'une cinquantaine. Le semis direct est une technique de reboisement très adaptée aux zones arides, parce qu'elle permet l'épanouissement du système racinaire, essentiel à l'adaptation de la plante à son milieu. La technique développée par Rewild.Earth est basée sur 35 ans de recherches sur les types d'espèces qui peuvent être établies, les configurations d'ensemencement, les profondeurs de semis, les traitements de semences, les modes et durées de conservation des semences et bien d'autres paramètres. Elle a permis de trouver les diversités optimales de techniques pour reboiser les champs de culture céréalières avec des essences indigènes, sans nécessiter d'irrigation ni d'engrais, et à bas coût, tout en conservant la génétique naturelle des espèces. Plus de 100 espèces différentes ont été expérimentées. Ces espèces sont ensuite de grandes valeurs alimentaires,"

Transformation et valorisation des fruits, graines et feuilles des espèces d’arbres alimentaires indigènes du pays. Celles-ci, au nombre de quelques douzaines dans leur ensemble, ont des saisons de récoltes décalés, permettant de créer de l’activité en milieu rural tous les mois de l’année. Leur adaptation naturelle au climat aride sahélien font qu’ils résistent mieux aux années de sécheresse ou de décalage pluviométrique, et peuvent produire souvent même lorsque les céréales classiques échouent. Aussi, certains de ces espèces ont une productivité moyenne supérieur aux cultures céréalières, tel que l’arbuste de hanza (Boscia senegalensis) qui produit en moyenne 100g de pseudo-céréale par m2 d’espace de champ occupé, ce qui vaut plus de deux fois la production céréalière classique. Finalement, les aliments des arbres pris dans leur ensemble couvrent tous les éléments nutritifs nécessaires à l’organisme humain. Cependant, ils ont souvent besoin d’une transformation pour faciliter leur préparation en cuisine, ou pour écarter des composants amers présents à leur état naturel. Ces transformations les rendent adaptés aux habitudes de consommateurs du 21ème siècle et leur permet de redécouvrir leurs usages traditionnels, tout en y ajoutant des innovations sur les produits à en dériver. Les aliments d’arbres transformés, bien qu’ayant été utilisés dans l’histoire, ont été abandonnés en temps modernes et souvent fortement stigmatisés comme aliments de pénurie et de famine. Cette initiative reprend ces aliments oubliés, méprisés d’arbres indigènes saharao-saheliens à morphologie souvent épineuse et ratatinée, et à saveurs bruts souvent sérieusement amères, afin de les transformer en aliments de qualité pouvant être appréciés comme des délices et pratiques à consommer pour l’homme du 21ème siècle."

Space Technology Agency (STA) specializes in tracking air and water pollution in informal settlements. STA aims to advance the inclusive use of space science tools and services for socio-economic development. STA expects to impact Uganda through an improved sewerage management system and increased mechanisms that will reduce air and water pollution. STA use modern technology to measure air and water quality against the index, their aerosol micro-robots measure with reference to the Air Quality Index (AQI) and Water Quality Index (WQI) respectively, purity or contamination details are then interpreted in their medium. STA’S solution will make use of technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics to determine the quality index. Using the AI route, images of water and air will be fed into a model which extracts features to be utilized in figuring out the quality index of the air or water. The data set created will contain images from different geographical positions with their accompanying quality indices to be fed into STA’s model used in mobile devices and robotics. This solution makes use of robotics with different sensors and cameras. They may include: 1. Camera 2. Carbon monoxide sensor 3. Carbon dioxide sensor 4. A combined ph. and temperature sensor 5. Turbidity sensor 6. Lidar sensor These sensors are used to formulate a micro-robot or even included on a drone used for surveys and to gather necessary data for the air quality and water quality indices. They are made from 3D printed material and electronically recycled components, all of which can be obtained locally. The solution provides data on change detection for Air and Water pollution in slums of Kampala and provides a warning system for contamination levels in the environment as a means to prevent health hazards caused by pollution.

Some are sprouting for self-sufficiency other farmers has turned it into business that generate a decent income. Farmers chose barley over other kind of sprouted seed to feed their livestock because it is high production rate (1 kg of seeds gives 7kg sprouted) and more importantly because nutritional benefits in barely are high than in other seeds. How: Barley needs a controlled climate to sprout, some farmers are building rooms with special conditions to control climate and light.

Plastic waste has attracted widespread concern and attention in Kenya. The rapid rate of urbanization throughout the world has led to the generation of increasing amounts of waste, including plastic waste and this in turn poses difficulties for disposal. The problem is more acute in developing countries such as Kenya. The ban on plastic bags/carriers took effect on 28th August 2017 which is a positive move towards reducing plastic waste. A more constraining issue arises on how to dispose off the current waste. Megagas focuses on the manufacturing of clean cooking gaseous fuel from various polymeric compounds, commonly known as plastic waste. This waste is found easily and cheaply thus making the product affordable and sustainable. James Isedia Mulema the founder of Megagas stumbled on the idea of manufacturing clean cooking fuel during trials to use plastic waste to harvest storm water. In 2014 he harvested his first gas into a makeshift cylinder he had made. Through this innovation, he has provided jobs for the youth by hiring them to collect the plastic waste, the raw material that he uses to produce the gas."

It is every farmer's dream to earn money from their produce promptly, but for Mr. Githuki Mwangi, this dream never materialized for the many years that he farmed coffee. Eventually, he decided to uproot his coffee trees and try his hand at something else. Mwangi has introduced a system that will pulp coffee at farm level, meaning that farmers will not have to transport their produce to a factory or a cooperative. The system which is powered by motorcycles has a capacity of processing over 400 kilos of cherry per hour compared to just 50 kilos which farmers achieve through manual pulping.

De 1973 à ce jour, plusieurs stratégies et programmes ont été développés sans arriver à un résultat satisfaisant. C’est pour répondre à ce besoin que nous avons mis au point ce dispositif qui minimise l’usage du bois et permet une production énergétique à haut rendement, y compris sur le plan écologique. Le réchaud à charbon de bois ou à charbon minéral est en deux compartiments. Le réservoir d’eau en bas et le fourneau au-dessus. Le fourneau est d’abord mis en activité avec du charbon ordinaire. La chaleur provenant du fourneau chauffe l’eau du réservoir qui se transforme en vapeur. La vapeur passe à travers des conduits à l’intérieur du fourneau pour activer la combustion. Et il se crée un mouvement cyclique. L’eau attise la combustion et la combustion transforme l’eau en vapeur pour continuer à attiser le fourneau. La ventilation est si forte que le charbon minéral y brûle vivement sans fumée jusqu’à épuisement. En quoi est-ce que cette solution / initiative locale est-elle innovante ?

La conservation des produits champêtres post-récolte ainsi que la mise en valeur par la transformation alimentaire demandent souvent que les produits soient séchés. Ceci se fait traditionnellement à l’air libre, dans des conditions qui ne répondent pas au normes hygiéniques : contacts avec les mouches et lézards, contamination par le sable et la poussière, perte de vitamines par l’impact direct des rayons solaires. Une réponse efficace à cela est le séchoir solaire. Sahara Sahel Foods et Rewild. Earth ont conçu un modèle de séchoir solaire fabriqué localement, à haute capacité. permettant de sécher les produits alimentaires dans des bonnes conditions hygiéniques. Le séchoir consiste à une rangée de six cabinets de douze claies chacune, alimentés par des aspirateurs et expirateurs d’air solaires. Le tout se connecte à un panneau collecteur de chaleur qui chauffe l’air de séchage avant son introduction dans le séchoir. Ceci donne une superficie de séchage totale de 46m2. En quoi est-ce que cette solution / initiative locale est-elle innovante ? La solution est innovante parce qu’elle permet de fabriquer les séchoirs localement, réduisant les coûts d’acquisition et facilitant l’entretien. Le modèle est optimisé aux conditions climatiques nigériennes, et utilise les principes découverts par un chercheur solaire nigérien (plus particulièrement le Prof. Albert Wright) pour maximiser l’effet de l’énergie. Le système de ventilation travail avec de l’énergie solaire photovoltaïque à l’aide de ventilateurs de radiateurs de véhicules, sélectionnés pour la circulation maximale de l’air par rapport à l’énergie consommé. Ainsi, le système est entièrement autonome et peut être installé dans n’importe quel village ou communauté rurale de la République du Niger. Le modèle est la 7ème itération de conception de séchoir de Sahara Sahel Foods, permettant de capitaliser sur les leçons apprises sur tous les modèles antérieurs afin d’obtenir un séchoir pratique, efficace et durable.

Contexte Depuis l’apparition du coronavirus, le consommateur subit une hausse des prix des denrées alimentaires qui sont devenues rares sur le marché. Face à cela, le gouvernement a publié un arrêté pour enrayer cette hausse en plafonnant les prix pratiqués. L’Etat compte sur le soutien de la population qui doit dénoncer tout commerçant ou détaillant qui refuse de respecter l’arrêté. L’arrêté souffre d’un manque d’application de la part des commerçants et détaillants. 1. Fermeture des frontières qui empêche les grossistes de fournir assez de denrées pour tout le monde ; 2. Faible application de l’arrêté ; 3. Hausse des prix. Solution Création d’une application mobile pour permettre à la population de dénoncer les commerçants et détaillants qui ne respectent pas l’arrêté, en prenant en photo le produit et en fournissant les informations nécessaires à la localisation du professionnel. 1. Avec le nombre de dénonciations, l’Etat pourra faire pression sur les grossistes ; 2. L’Etat peut directement réprimander les commerçants et les détaillants ; 3. Baisse des prix dans le respect de l’arrêté. C’est une application mobile simple suffit, pas besoin de fonctionnalités complexes.

Contexte
Dans ce contexte de propagation de la Covid-19, nombreuses sont les initiatives engagées à travers le monde, afin de contribuer, à l'effort national visant à atténuer les répercussions de cette pandémie et la prévenir. Selon les moyens et les idées qui leur sont propres les Etats et des citoyens se sont engagés à chercher de nouvelles solutions pour protéger la santé des populations.
C`est dans cette situation que notre Entreprise INOVATECH a rapidement développé le Portique de Désinfection des Germes de maladies Infectieuses (PDGI), une innovation pour mettre sa compétence au service de cette cause. L’innovateur Hassane Bissala Y, phytopathologie de formation estime que c’est un devoir de présenter un service à son pays dans de telles circonstances.

Solution
Le renforcement des mesures barrières d’hygiène et de lutte contre l’infection peuvent limiter la propagation de micro-organismes résistants et réduire l’utilisation abusive et à mauvais escient des antimicrobiens.
Le Portique de Désinfection des Germes de maladies Infectieuses (PDGI) est un équipement physique qui rassemble en un seul outil, l`essentiel des mesures barrières conventionnelles recommandées par les États.
Il assure un seul passage la distanciation physique, la désinfection des semelles de chaussures, le lavage des mains, le port des bavettes et la désinfection des tenues vestimentaires des visiteurs.
Avantage du PDGI : en général les dispositifs de lavage des mains déposés devant les entrées des bâtiments sont très peu utilisés par les visiteurs pour diverses raisons. Le PDGI apporte une correction à cette négligence car les visiteurs sont contraints de passer dans le portique pour accéder aux lieux.

About 48tonnes of unsegregated waste is generated per day and directed to landfills resulting in a reduced lifespan for the city’s landfill and an unsustainable living environment for the city of Mbabane. Furthermore, unemployment remains high in the city, yet opportunities to derive livelihoods from waste exist for the city’s dwellers. Additionally, inappropriately managed waste can result in the outbreak of diseases. The absence of an appropriate legal instrument to promote sustainable waste management practices has resulted in the slow uptake of recycling and sustainable waste management practices. Additionally, current waste management practices have resulted in a big carbon footprint for the city. 
The solution aims at:
- Promoting waste segregation as a social norm in Mbabane City
- Enabling and encouraging legislation on waste segregation
- Using waste to improve livelihoods by transforming waste management into sustainable business opportunities.
- Introducing new Technologies of Composting (i.e. bokashi) – with the aim of improving soil nutrients, increasing yields for organic produce, thus improving livelihoods, and providing economic incentives for good environmental practices through, i.e. sale of organic compost and farmers produce from backyard gardens,
- Reducing the city’s carbon footprint, as a climate action response,
The project is currently being piloted at 4 Mbabane communities (namely Pine Valley, Mbangweni, Woodlands and Msunduza) and 76 business outlets. The opportunities for income generation especially for the businesses, and the benefits currently observed make the potential for sustainability of this initiatives high. Additionally, through the learnings from this piloting phase and the passing of the Waste Management Regulations, the project will be scaleable to all other communities within the Municipal Council of Mbabane’s jurisdiction."

Financial exclusion / lack of access to credit facilities: Most potential entrepreneurs, especially in rural areas are unemployed, financially dependent on other people, have no credit history in the country, or are unbanked, and they reside in becoming financially excluded due to their social status. With the COVID-19 pandemic at play, exchanging frequently touched items, including notes and coins could transmit the virus as well. Inconvenience: People have to leave their comfort zones in order to deposit or withdraw cash to make purchases. Others are very busy to do so, thus limiting the amount of time on spending, in which the government needs for economic growth. 
ePayNet is a technological innovation that aims at: - Empowering woman entrepreneurs by helping them get access to quick or instant loans in order for them to start and operate their own businesses. - Reducing the spread of COVID-19 through the use of FINTECH, limiting the number of people travelling to the most congested areas to deposit or get cash, and to avoid the exchange of notes and coins from one hand to another. - Bringing great convenience to all ePayNet clients. Enabling clients to make transactions at the comfort of their spaces at reasonable charges. In partnership with MTN, Digimage Investments developed a FINTECH driven solution towards financial inclusion. The initiative enhances client experience through an electronic platform to process payments through mobile money or bank cards. It offers interoperability between banks and mobile money for people to transfer funds between the two at the comfort of their spaces. The initiative links clients (including woman entrepreneurs in rural areas, who cannot move around in search of funds due to increased costs and the COVID-19 pandemic) to their SACCOS, stokvels and micro lenders, so they can borrow, repay and save via the platform. Clients also make donations, give offerings, pay school fees, pay to companies and utility bills. The product relies on excessive training of staff (both Digimage and MTN) and clients on how to use product, and robust marketing."

C'est un dispositif technique qui consiste à récupérer les eaux de ruissellement tout évitant l'ensablement des bassins de stockage d'eau. Le dispositif refoule le sable et laisse passer uniquement l'eau dans le bassin de rétention. Les bassins de rétention des eaux pluviales peuvent être à ciel ouverts ou enterrés. Le dispositif a pour fonction d'assurer la disponibilité de l'eau dans les champs.
En cas de sécheresse il sera ainsi possible d'irriguer les plantes et d'arroser les composteurs grâce à l'eau stockée. Le RER est conçu pour épargner les équilibres hydriques et écologiques naturels des plantes durant les périodes de sécheresse. Il peut assurer une disponibilité d'eau jusqu'à trois mois à près la fin de la saison des pluies en fonction de sa capacité. Les dimensions et le nombre de ces bassins sont variables selon les besoins et les moyens du paysan. Pour les bassins situés sur une surface plane le remplissage commence à partir d'une pluie de 20 mm, Pour les bassins situés dans une trajectoire des eaux de ruissellement le remplissage commence à partir de 15 mm de pluie. Le RER complète le Réservoir à Programmation Semi-automatique (RPS) dans les champs.
Réservoir semi-automatique: C'est un dispositif programmable de ravitaillement en eau des plantes suivant des intervalles de temps et de débit bien définis d’avance. Le programme est introduit dans réservoir d'eau, il est mécanique et n'a pas besoin de source d'énergie pour son fonctionnement et de cerveau électronique central programmable. Il s’inscrit dans la logique des innovations low-tech (basse technologie) et « low-cost (bas coûts / à bas prix). Il est pratique très peu onéreux et économique.

Overall goal: Assess air quality, humidity and temperature in different cities of Argentina. Specific goals: • Map the air pollution affecting the population and learn about the changes in pollution levels. • Design corridors for climate change mitigation across urban areas, defining a strategy to understand the scope and limitations of measurements. • Provide technical and educational evidence for citizens to access information that will allow them to know the quality of the air they breathe, and the relation between pollution, climate change and urban dynamics. 
Description of citizen participation: It involves the development of low-cost sensors by students from public universities at workshops organized by Argentina's Ministry of Environmental and Sustainable Development (MAyDS in Sapnish) and UNDP. Each sensor weighs 500 grams and measures different variables, such as the levels of particles suspended in the air, humidity, and temperature. Once assembled, the sensors are delivered and fixed to the bikes and backpacks of the volunteers selected. Volunteer selection is based on frequency of circulation and daily commutes across urban and adjoining areas. After a certain number of weeks, sensor data are collected to create air pollution maps. Volunteers can see the level of pollution they are exposed to along their daily commutes, and they may provide solutions to reduce their own emissions.

Contributory project: It is designed by scientists, and citizens participate in data collection. 
Overall goal: Assess ocean acidification in the coastal area of Mar del Plata.
Description of citizen participation: The idea behind ""El Veril del Banco de Afuera"" (Outer Bank Reef) lies in the collaboration between the National Institute for Fisheries Research and Development (INIDEP in Spanish) and the ""Escualo” Underwater Activities Center (CASE in Spanish) diving club in collecting information on the marine environment in order to coordinate an integrated monitoring effort towards the evaluation of possible changes linked to ocean acidification in the coastal site of Mar del Plata. CASE scuba divers collect seawater samples (for the analysis of pH levels and total alkalinity, salinity, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll-a, phytoplankton and bacterioplankton abundance) during their recreational outings to ""El Veril"" (a coastal site visited by divers due to its good visibility and variety of marine species) on a semi-monthly basis. They also record the metadata required at the sampling site (GPS coordinates, date and time, sampling depth, the dive computer temperature profiles, and sea conditions).

Contributory project: It is designed by scientists, and citizens participate in data collection.
Overall goals: Contribute to the conservation and management of Olrog’s Gulls (Larus atlanticus) considering their habitats and their behavioral flexibility in the event of any potential changes in the conditions of the area they inhabit. The ultimate goal of this project is to contribute to the implementation of ecosystem policies in the management of the marine and coastal environment. Specific goals: • Determine the migration movements of Olrog’s Gull specimens using citizens’ reports on ringed birds. • Study habitat selection by this species during the non-breeding season in areas exposed to different anthropic impacts and link such information with the data collected on their individual condition and behavioral patterns.
Description of citizen participation: During field research, Olrog’s Gull specimens are caught for ringing. As part of the monitoring process, individuals are ringed, molting characteristics are recorded, and samples of blood and feces are taken. Additionally, behavioral tests are conducted to determine their personality traits and flexibility. The information gathered may be compared with the reports on ringed birds found in different coastal areas in the south of the continent. Citizens record ringed birds and report the number on their ring by sending a photo and the location of the bird (georeferencing).

Collaborative project: Citizens participate in data collection and analysis.
Overall goal: • Provide a low-cost device for indoor ventilation monitoring by measuring carbon dioxide (CO2). • Reduce the probability of contracting airborne diseases, such as COVID-19, among others. • Contribute to enhance performance of people sharing indoor spaces by monitoring ventilation. Specific goals: Research CO2 meter designs, select those that use components available in Argentina, build a working prototype and make the circuit and microcontroller programming code freely and publicly available.
Description of citizen participation: Citizens are provided with a CO2 meter, equivalent to a ""thermometer"", and receive basic training. They learn that the optimal outdoor ventilation rate is about 400 parts per million (PPM), while the indoor ventilation rate can easily reach 2500 PPM. Therefore, if during monitoring, the value is less than 800 PPM, citizens will record that ventilation is adequate and they can remain indoors with a low risk, as long as they keep at least a one (1) meter distance and wear a mask (in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic). On the other hand, if the value rises, citizens know that they will have to increase ventilation or, otherwise, leave the room until the air is renewed.

There are days when the residents of Los Pinos cannot enjoy such simple habits as going out to their yards to drink a cold beverage or get together with friends to have a barbecue in the open air. The inhabitants of this rural community in Balcarce district in Buenos Aires must share dinners with flies and strong odors from the enormous amounts of livestock waste that accumulate everywhere without finding a better destination. In addition, they suffer frequent power outages, consequently, access to water is difficult, since the way to extract it is through electric pumps. They also do not have a natural gas network and depend on the use of gas containers or firewood for heating and cooking. Based on this community problem, researchers from different affiliations decided to use their technical knowledge to find a solution that could solve more than one problem: a biodigester to obtain gas from livestock waste. The groundbreaking implications of this project (also known as the ""Biogas Demonstration Unit for the Development of Sustainable Rural Energy"") is not only the generation of biogas through the waste of poultry and pigs, or that the municipality joined the academy and the community, or that the community schools submit projects at national level to replicate the experience, but, in addition to all this, the inhabitants of Los Pinos formed a Cooperative to be able to make it sustainable over time, showing interest, commitment, desire for improvement and a bet for the future. 
Prototype system
The amount of biomass available is such that, according to the survey conducted in the community, it could be used to feed a plant ten or fifteen times larger than the one being built. But it is a start: the work in progress is a concrete biodigester with a capacity to store 100 cubic meters.

Online education has been gaining grounds all around the world, essentially because of convenience and cost-effectiveness. The pandemic, imposing its ravages on on-site in-person schooling, generated a boost for online education. However, online education is dependent on the availability of ICT infrastructure, hardware, and software, which are expensive and thus, invariably place developing countries among the community of nations, and resource-poor segments of population within each country in a highly disadvantaged position. The impact of the pandemic on education in Bangladesh has been an alarming “education deficit”, and in the underprivileged rural sector, a deficit of a disastrous proportion. To address this education deficit, Accelerator Lab Bangladesh, in collaboration with the Volunteers Association for Bangladesh (VAB) supported 191 digitally underprivileged high school students from 9 schools across 5 districts (Jashore, Satkhira, Kurigram, Nilphamari and Pabna) to receive e-learning for their 2021 Secondary School Certificate (SSC) preparation via tablets and digital contents related to the three Science subjects on which the exam in the Science “stream” was held – Physics, Chemistry and Biology.

1. Climate change induced disasters such as tropical storms, cyclones and monsoon floods are recurring events in Bangladesh. Every year different parts of Bangladesh face different types of disasters. Exposure to disaster causes considerable damage to assets and livelihood opportunities of affected households. In response, households adopt private defensive measures investing their private funds, which acts as an additional financial burden. There is very limited information available about expenditure on disaster risk reduction and recovery in the country. In this context, to understand the types of expenditure, differences in expenditure by gender and help minimize them, the Accelerator Lab, in collaboration with the UK based International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED) commissioned a survey to assess the percentage of climate-related expenditure as a share of household income and expenditure in climate-vulnerable regions of Bangladesh. This research closely complements the “Strengthening Governance of Climate Change Finance to Enhance Gender Equality” project of UNDP Bangladesh. The findings of this study can help the Accelerator Lab narrow down specific district and female-headed households, most vulnerable and in risk of exposure to floods and storms, which holds promise for the lab to pilot new climate financing approaches and innovative adaptation solutions in the future."

The innovation: Urban Grow House Network This is an expansion of an existing urban garden solution that can be utilized by persons in their space to produce food items for themselves and suppliers within their area. As food prices continually rise amidst the supply chain disruptions this solution not only produces affordable food in small urban spaces, it can also provide a revenue stream from excess yields that we can purchase and distribute to our network
From the insight gained from the existing model, the activity seems profitable and sustainable. The solution developer is seeking to refine the Grow Houses using locally sourced bamboo. Bamboo is an invasive species that grows quickly and requires no human tending. Bamboo’s fibrous stem is also strong and versatile. The Grow Houses are tailored to the Caribbean climate and, even apart from the bamboo, the grow houses will be made out of locally sourced repurposed sustainable materials. Mr. Samlalsingh seeks to build a network of these Grow Houses and continually refine methodologies with the new data gained from the unique micro environments of every new site.
How the innovation started? This innovation began in 2015 so that we could produce healthy food on a consistent and easy basis for a household. We utilized methods from different agricultural methods such as aquaponics and companion planting to build our own semi intensive system. It has changed over time from producing leafy greens, to seedlings, to vegetables. We have been constantly rebuilding and refining the most efficient use of space and methodologies 
The Future? To make the operations more environmentally sustainable with regard to water management and to eliminate all non-renewable materials, such as plastics. Mr. Samlalsingh seeks to develop a manual for the solution so that it can be shared regionally and with institutions such as the UNDP so that it can make a greater impact globally"

Problem being solved? Pollution and waste due to feminine personal hygiene and sexual education
This project locally produces and distributes cloth menstrual pads as an eco-friendly alternative to disposable menstrual products, as well as engaging in sexual and reproductive health education. 
What's the solution?
In 2018, Amy Li Baksh embarked on her own eco-friendly/reusable journey and went looking for locally made reusable products. She couldn't find any. Recognizing that this was a huge hole in our local market and wanting to create a product that could help solve the issue of plastic waste she began experimenting with hand-made, cloth sanitary pads for women. She also realized that to get women to use them she would have to fill some of the gaps in our local education when it comes to sexual and reproductive health. She also designs the fabric prints used for the pads since she felt Caribbean artwork was the best way to make an unfamiliar product seem less intimidating and to give persons who menstruate a positive and beautiful connection to their periods rather than the clinical white products they are used to using.
""I would like to change the local culture of menstrual product use not only in Trinidad and Tobago but across the Caribbean. Ideally I want to reach the most underserved communities rather than only engaging with communities already privileged with access to education and funding. I am currently limited by the small production team (myself and one other person) as well as pandemic-related issues with shipping in some of the fabric I use that is not currently available locally.""
Future of the Innovation and Future Prospects
Accessing the female prisons where there is a shortage of sanitary pads. Also a widespread distribution system so that pads can be sent to persons across the Caribbean, as well as opportunities to engage with marginalized communities and do educational workshops on sexual and reproductive health.

The global pandemic has had an adverse impact on learning and equity; but it also provided an opportunity to rethink the way students are educated. To explore this, the UNDP Accelerator Lab joined hands with the Volunteers Association for Bangladesh (VAB) – a grassroots organization dedicated to rural education since 2000 - to pilot an innovative E-Learning project. It is assisting rural and disadvantaged high school students from 9 schools across five districts - the majority being girls - on their preparation for the upcoming 2021 national secondary school certificate (SSC) examination through e-learning via tablets and digital contents. However, it is yet to be tested how effective and impactful are online-learning models via tablets and digital contents for digitally underprivileged rural high-school students, especially girls, for the preparation of their SSC examination. The Accelerator Lab is conducting a baseline survey to assess the current and the pre-pilot implementation status of digital underprivileged rural high school students from 5 districts in Bangladesh on relevant indicators, and an end line survey to assess the progress, results, and impact of the pilot (online-learning model via tablet and digital contents) intervention (including samples from non-tablet users) to deliver the necessary knowledge around impact of such models."

In this context, in line with UNDP Accelerator Lab’s Mission of reducing the Gender Digital Divide and increase female representation in the Bangladesh’s Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Space, an all-women digital hackathon was organized in July 2021. The Accelerator Lab’s women’s digital innovation hackathon aimed to promote ICT skills and innovation to female students and young professionals and find new digital solutions to a wide range of social problems, that can be piloted within the Accelerator lab network to address key development challenges of Bangladesh. While it was organized as a competition, the aim was to offer encouragement and learning opportunities to the participants. The Hackathon had two Challenge Tracks: Digital Transformation & Smart City. There was 200+ applications submitted. The top 3 teams of each Hack received funding to grow their innovative solutions after the event, with the Gold award being worth $1500 USD plus scholarships to Edx’s professional certificate series in deep learning and fintech, silver award being $1000 USD and Bronze award being $500 USD.

They function as an informal business and a scrap site owner we spoke to described himself as a business owner. They also work with pick up truck drivers who drive around to pick up scrap from neighborhoods. They may also have connections with migrant workers who work as apartment building guards and cleaners, who help the scrap sites with procuring material from apartments. 
They not only sell material, but they may also repair products (such as electronics) and sell them for half the original price.

To formulate solutions to this end, the Bangladesh Accelerator Lab conducted several extended field visits to this region and, in consultation with the locals, identified a portfolio of solutions to address the plethora of prevalent challenges and promote sustainable tourism in the CHT. One of the challenges identified is that there is a lack of tour packages that provide combined mountain & sea tours, which is an expectation from tourists since CHT is close to Cox Bazar - the largest uninterrupted sea beach in the world. To address this issue, training can be provided to the tour operators to develop tour packages such as 3 days package, 5 days package and 10 days package for areas such as Thanchi, Ruma Cox's Bazar and Bilai chhori, thus covering both mountain and sea."

To formulate solutions to this end, the Bangladesh Accelerator Lab conducted several extended field visits to this region and, in consultation with the locals, identified a portfolio of solutions to address the plethora of prevalent challenges and promote sustainable tourism in the CHT. 
One of the key challenges identified is that there is a dearth of relevant local policies regarding tourism in the CHT region. For e.g., the rates of boat rides are not standardized, with different boats charging different amounts to tourists. Similarly, when tourists rent cars, there is no clarity regarding whether parking fee is included with the renting fee of the car, and when tourists are unprepared for these hidden costs and are charged different parking fees at different spots, it often creates resentment and can give them a negative tourism experience, discouraging future visits.
To address these concerns, policies can be developed to make such fees standardized and publicly listed. If there is a price list available, that can help increase transparency and enable the tourists to make informed decisions about the costs. Relevant good policies regarding tourism from other regions in the country could also be replicated in the CHT."

UNDP Bangladesh Accelerator Lab joined hands with 'PathFinder’ - a unique, virtual cross-cultural educational platform that aims to educate K-12 level students, including disadvantaged schools - to develop a multi-country program to introduce entrepreneurship education to high-school students. The idea was to empower these students, unleash their creativity, encourage a mindset of abundance and self-determination, and promote purposeful entrepreneurial action. The Accelerator Lab in collaboration with Pathfinder organized a bootcamp in which 24 students participated, of which fourteen were from Bangladesh, six from Zambia, four from India, one from Sweden, and nine from the Philippines. There were three workshops designed for the participants, focusing on SDG - 4 ‘Quality Education’, SDG-5, ‘Gender Equality’, and SDG-17 ‘Partnership for Goals’. The workshops were on SDG learning, Problem Framing, and Human-Centric Design Thinking which was conducted by subject matter specialists. These workshops enhanced the participants’ knowledge about digging into a problem and finding practical solutions. During the problem-solving sessions students identified some of the biggest challenges in their home countries and other participating nations in the Bootcamp. The students devised solutions to their identified problems and presented their solution ideas to the judges and the winning team was provided a mini grant from Peace First to implement their idea. This bootcamp sparked passion among the participating high school students and inspired them to put their ideas into action. The Bootcamp was an international collaboration made possible due to strong support from a diverse group of institutions including The Resolution Project, Peace First, Impact Hub Dhaka, OC365, and Unleash Plus. In early 2022, PathFinder is launching its three-month-long cohort with UNDP Accelerator Lab Bangladesh and partner organizations. Through these cohorts, 250+ students will be engaged to become SDG solution change-makers to make our community more inclusive and sustainable."

The whistle is distributed along with flyers and other items that have the telephones of police and authorities. The sound will be an alert signal to call for support and to try to disinhibit the attacker while the authorities are called to 911. The whistle is relevant because often the police can take a long time to answer and alternative means of support are required.

Beyond the tools, the innovation here is the focus, reconsidering work as an important network for every person that can be more than just a transactional salary-task exchange.
So far more than 700 have been supported to escape abusive relationships legally, financially, and emotionally and the company has paid to relocate over 100 of these women.

Selling ‘bila’, a traditional Fijian delicacy made from fermented cassava is a major source of income for many women from Tailevu, Fiji. To make bila: cassava is peeled, washed, and grated. Juice from grated cassava is left to sit for over four nights before cooking it, which takes approximately two (or more) days. It is a long process that usually takes more than six days. The end product is then sold for FJD$1 a piece.
Fermentation increases the amount of B vitamins in the cassava, therefore the process of making bila adds nutritional value to cassava.
Additionally, bila is usually made from leftover cassava crop from farms and market produce that were not able to be sold, so it has become an innovative way to address food waste.

The introduction of the company's new cassava flour product, using locally sourced cassava, will provide increased employment, reduce food loss, and raise people’s standard of living. The process of turning cassava into flour adds value to an already commonly grown crop.
Cassava flour is gluten-free, rich in carbohydrates and Vitamin C, and low in calories, fat, and sugar. It also contains more protein and fiber than white (wheat) flour.
In 2020, Fiji imported approximately $111.4million worth of wheat. A shift to cassava flour by the local market, or occasionally alternating between wheat and cassava flour may mean a slight reduction on the high importation of wheat, as the latter works as a suitable import substitute for wheat flour.

Improving labor productivity of informal waste pickers (as an enabler for financing better social protection) requires collective action in the recycling system to improve sorting of waste and the logistics of waste collection. We observed how strengthening the capacity of associations or organizations of informal workers, particularly the trust among them and between them and other actors in the recycling system, are key elements in the pathway towards productivity and the formalization of associative relationships. Both these processes are signaling toward a long-term investment in their cooperative practices and collective assets as the tools to facilitate the formalization of their work by enabling access to social protection.

Description: A 25-year-old Fijian medical student came up with the innovative idea to make breadfruit flour and through this business venture ‘Grassroots Fiji’, he is also assisting some Nadi villagers who have been affected by COVID-19, by sourcing all raw produce from these villages. Breadfruit flour is said to be a healthier alternative to wheat flour as it is gluten free, has low glycemic index, and is nutrient dense. Additionally, breadfruit protein is easier to digest than wheat protein.

The Moana Taka Partnership is a memorandum of understanding (MoU) between the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment (SPREP) and The China Navigation Company (CNCo). The partnership allows for CNCo vessels to carry containers of recyclable waste from eligible Pacific Island ports, without charge, to be sustainably treated or recycled in appropriate ports in Asia Pacific. This helps address some of the issues the Pacific Islands face regarding waste management barriers such as lack of waste treatment/ recycling infrastructure and geographical limitations. 21 countries are eligible for these opportunities: American Samoa, Cook Islands, Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, Fiji, French Polynesia, Kiribati, Republic of the Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, New Caledonia, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor Leste, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and Wallis and Futuna. How it works: Swire Shipping, the liner business division of CNCo, regularly repositions empty shipping containers across the Pacific, which presents an ideal opportunity to transport recyclable waste out from these islands to other countries with suitable infrastructure.

To explore and map the untapped potential in ‘digital transformation’ that can accelerate action towards achieving SDGs in Cook Islands, Niue, Samoa, & Tokelau. Exploration and mapping of untapped potential in digital transformation for this GAP encompasses citizen participation with digital literacy. It is why the Accelerator Lab has chosen to map selected high schools under the Governance and Poverty Reduction Unit project with the Samoa Information and Technology Association as its initial foray into understanding the potential areas of interest in digital transformation.
Observations: Most of the computer labs visited including all government schools’ in Savaii either had obsolete machines that was only good for MS Office use or the labs were empty with the computers having been cleared out due to damage or non-use. The Accelerator Lab supported SITA in this endeavor by providing 2 routers (i.e. Vodafone and Digicel) for students and teachers to access the internet. However, it is to be noted that the best coverage in most of Savaii is that of Digicel. During the school lockdown when Covid-19 was first declared a pandemic, the schools has manually prepared and printed all learning materials for students which were then dropped off and picked up individual using teachers personal resources. Accessibility to wifi internet was very limited. SITA had also shared that when there is no router available, internet access for the trainings would be via mobile hotspot.

Even though civil registration is critical to citizen participation and effective governance, 44% of countries do not have functioning CRVS systems. Countries are currently stuck with inefficient paper-based systems or expensive and poorly designed information systems that are not flexible enough to adapt to changing operational environments. These existing systems do not meet the needs and capacities of the civil registration staff, leaving large parts of the population unregistered, unrecognised, and unprotected.
OpenCRVS is challenging the current gap in the market for a user-centric and rights-based CRVS system by leading the development of OpenCRVS, an open-source digital CRVS solution that is free to use, adaptable to the country context, interoperable with other government systems (e.g. health and ID systems), and rights-based to ensure it protects and provides for those most vulnerable.

OpenCRVS has the potential to go well beyond the scope of traditional CRVS systems. We see OpenCRVS as a foundational identity and population data system which will support and maintain the integrity of many other service delivery, statistical and identity management functions. In particular, OpenCRVS will ensure that these functions are above all inclusive, providing a digital response to the global call to “Leave No One Behind”.
Digital Transformation is one of the top priority areas for the government. In this a secure, open source technology for creating digital public good is quite relevant for Samoa and other SIDS that are trying to overcome the geographical exclusion through effective employment of digital solutions.

Globally, the effort for solving waste tyre problems through market-based value-adding waste tyre management options is as old as tyre itself. These include reusing, de-vulcanization, mechanical and thermal (including pyrolysis) processing. Disposal options such as land filling and stockpiling are also practiced. Tyre pyrolysis is a thermal process carried out in the absence of oxygen for producing oil, carbon char black and gases from used tyres and recovering the steel wires in the tyre. This presents an opportunity to consider scrap tyre pyrolysis as a business. Pyrolysis is emerging as a more efficient way to utilize the resources in scrap tyres compared to the other options. From pyrolysis of scrap tyres, four products are obtained: oil, carbon char, fuel gas and steel wire. Pyrolysis is preferable because of the following reasons: It recycles 100% of the waste tyres. All valuable materials are extracted. It produces four valuable products out of waste tyres with no effect on the environment. They are “green” products.

2. Considers the environmental impact for weed management as a locally-sourced agent (vs. chemicals that have toxicology concerns as well as increasing issues with herbicide-resistant weeds - eg. in the last three decades, over two dozen weeds have developed resistance to glyphosate).

The performance of a worker in a company is closely linked to the commitment of their employer to make them feel satisfied with their work environment. We want to implement as a project a space of well-being for the officials of the institution, where they can find a monitor with images that congratulate them for their achievements through messages from the authorities or bosses, and images with motivating phrases for the official, where they can leave feedback on a tablet or box for complaints and suggestions. Also that it is a coworking space to socialize with other dependencies and there are amenities such as water, coffee, and once a week professionals from health fields such as nutrition, psychology, medicine, etc. appear. to develop healthy programs, Emphasis will be placed on mental health care with a research study on it. Another idea is that of a nursery in the institution for children of officials. Law 5508 and Regulatory Decree No. 7550/2017, on lactation rooms and nurseries oblige public institutions and public and private sector companies to implement them, but this does not really happen. Working Families points out in a study that employees who are parents and have a job that gives them a balance between their work life and their private life increase their sense of belonging and, for the most part, increase their productivity. Studies will be carried out to measure the impact of this solution.

The idea is to create a General Health Program to promote healthy habits and the control of diseases such as hypertension and diabetes in the Coronel Oviedo Penitentiary. Within this program, the axes would be exercise, healthy eating and mental health. Within the exercise axis, treadmills, bicycles and other safe elements would be acquired to carry out a crossfit program in the Penitentiary together with a trainer. Within the area of ​​healthy eating, training will be carried out with nutritionists since food is prepared within the penitentiary, and drinking fountains will be purchased to promote water intake. A base measurement will be carried out before and after the implementation of the Program together with the support of the Regional Institute of Health Research of the National University of Caaguazú. It will also be measured whether this exercise and healthy eating program has positive implications for mental health.

Community health agents and other staff of the territorial Family Health Units have very little historical perspective about the relationship between primary health care policy, human rights frameworks regarding health and citizen participation in policy making. This appears to limit their understanding and appropriation of participatory policy making and management tools that are mandated but underutilized by the ministry of public health. This led us to develop the following hypothesis, which is the focus of our experimental intervention in this learning loop: If we provide Family Health Unit workers training in the history of the Primary Health Care perspective, the role of participation, and the use of participatory planning tools, then they will appropriate these tools and make use of them in identifying their operations and priorities."

The Flavors of the North initiative is a group of organized peasant women who are dedicated to producing fresh food, nutritional supplements, pickled vegetables, sweets, jams and some sauces to sell at fairs in the Department of Concepción, in the northeast of the country. It is a team that works well together, with clear leadership and a good working environment between them. The fresh products that they currently sell have a very good acceptance by consumers and are also produced in most of the family farms in this rural area. The dream of this group of entrepreneurs is the amount of being able to improve their production capacity and quality, to occupy the market at the local and national level, with the added bonus of being organic products. Currently they sell these products as a complement, but they do not have sufficient quantity and quality because they do not have equipment (processing machines) and they do not know the appropriate techniques to prepare and package them so that they are preserved for a few days. They have their own premises, not very large, but it is the place where they make and process the products, it is located in the town of Arroyo de Oro km 92.5, district of Arroyito, department of Concepción PY.

Its vision is manifested in the contribution of actions that allow women from socially and economically marginalized areas to have access to better development opportunities through the success of their enterprises and their economic and personal empowerment, offering opportunities with proven impact, in an articulated, transparent manner and pushing its execution capacity to the limit. Among its most outstanding actions, and in primacy in the face of the crisis unleashed by the COVID-19 Pandemic, are those that faced and are facing to combat the hunger that surrounds the extreme poverty of families from different areas of the country, including the areas of Pte. Hayes, Ñeembucú, Central, Paraguarí: The popular pots are founded as a strategy in this management. In the analysis of the aforementioned reality established through interviews, statistics and visual materials PARAGUAY OBSERVA, visualizes the situation of extreme poverty of Paraguayan families, whose characteristics reflect chronic undernourishment, malnutrition and stunted growth of boys, girls and teenagers. The consequences are serious for the health and quality of life of individuals and communities. The reality that we mention confronts the fundamental right that people have to ""adequate food that is exercised when every man, woman or child, either alone or in common with others, has physical and economic access, at all times, to food or the means to obtain it” (FAO-Zero Hunger) When we OBSERVE, we think of solutions, of relief. We know that women in vulnerable situations can respond to the fight against poverty with activities that allow them to achieve equal rights, based on their will and labor force, offering the scope of equitable and economic means, in the search for better conditions. of life. WE OBSERVE, capacity and work experience in the field of bakery and confectionery. With minimal resources, women have placed a quality product on the market with easy access to society. With the management of women, the dishes of the popular pots have not lacked bread for lunch and cookies or cakes for snacks. WE OBSERVE that this response to the decisive empowerment of women in the task of fighting hunger becomes a business opportunity, of obtaining economic means, of viewing women as bearers of answers to their situation of poverty. WE OBSERVE that this alternative with better resources and machinery can become a real effort to achieve equal opportunities for gender, combat hunger and achieve dreams.

Plastic Pollution Challenge: Viet Nam is one of the largest fresh fruit and vegetable exporters in the world. However, agricultural products have low value due to a lack of effective post-harvest preservation, leading to 50% product loss. At the same time, the popular usage of plastic bags in the preservation process in transportation contributes to the problem of plastic pollution.
Solution: In July, 2020, GALAXY BIOTECH launched the BREATHABLE BIOBAG, a starch-based bag made from industrial cassava (tapioca) starch – a popular local species that grows well in harsh soil in the Highland and South-East regions of Viet Nam. The bag provides a solution for food preservation, while being biodegradable.
Innovation: The BREATHABLE BIOBAG tackles two urgent issues, including plastic pollution and food waste. Moreover, our solution also helps increase Viet Nam’s agricultural product – which is cassava, thus adding incomes for poor farmers. We have applied both biotechnology and nanotechnology to develop 4 types of eco-friendly food preserver bags, targeting the bio-packaging industry. We are innovating with bags that can keep vegetables, fruits, meat and fish fresher and protect them from bacteria and viruses. We have also developed a methodology to calculate the CO2 emissions to find ways to minimize pollution. Awards include:"

Plastic Pollution Challenge: People lack knowledge about waste sorting, means of reaching waste collectors, and incentive to sort waste. This leads to waste being dumped into the sea, making waste management difficult for authorities. Currently, there are 0.8 tons of uncollected plastic waste in the ocean.
Solution: mGreen is a mobile app that educates people about waste segregation, rewards them for taking part in recycling activities, and connects residents with collectors and merchants at shops and stores.
Innovation: We built 3 mobile applications for 3 groups of users – waste collectors, households, and store owners. This system encourages residents to sort garbage at home, helping collectors collect waste conveniently. Furthermore, the mGreen loyalty coalition platform also provides a system for merchant promotions, where points can be exchanged by mGreen users for customer care programs."

Plastic Pollution Challenge: Viet Nam currently has approximately 47,450 offshore and middle shore fishing vessels and about 300,000 fishermen in these waters. Since the vessels do not have plastic trash storage onboard, it is estimated that they dump about 1,400 tons of plastic waste at sea annually.
Solution: We provide a mini plastic squeezing machine and a mobile app for local fishermen to collect and convert plastic waste into necessary supplies for fishing activities. In the long run, the project is expected to reduce approximately 1,400 tons of plastic waste per year.
Innovation: The plastic squeezing machine is made of saltwater resistant materials and designed to fit in tight spaces on fishing vessels. and. It is operated with an electrical system on-board, and helps to reduce the size of used plastic bottles on-board by about 90%. Fishermen will bring back the plastic waste to the ports where they can exchange it, via a mobile app, for supplies for their next trips to sea, such as instant noodles, milk, mobile credit, shampoo, tooth paste, drinking water, cooking oil, etc.
Impact Model: The ultimate impact goals of the team include, but are not limited to: protect the ocean that is the habitat of fisheries resources; develop feasible mechanisms and policies for the collection of plastic waste from fishing vessels and exchange for goods. Our goals contribute to the achievement of the SDGs:"

Viet Nam is in the top 4 countries contributing to plastic waste entering the oceans, especially in Ha Long Bay, with 5,272 tons of plastic waste generated annually. Only 9% of plastic waste in Viet Nam is recycled, typically for low-value applications and simple use.
Solution:
EcoTech has developed a groundbreaking technology that turns many kinds of plastic waste into novel, high-value aerogel materials for billion-dollar markets, such as heat and sound insulation, high-temperature garments and oil spill clean up. A pilot has been launched in Singapore with the capacity to manufacture 250,000 m2 per year of aerogels from various wastes, including plastic, paper, textiles, rubber and agricultural waste).
Innovation:
EcoTech has successfully overcome the problem of plastic waste by developing a means to convert them into high-value aerogels for many useful applications – the first aerogel made from plastic waste. Eco-aerogels have practical applications, such as in oil-spill clean ups and heat and sound insulations, providing excellent water repellency, are highly compressible and ultra-low density, and have high-porosity, high absorption capacity and ultra-low thermal conductivity. At the end of their useful life, these aerogels can be recycled again to make other aerogels.

Collects and exports used cooking oil (UCO) for biofuel. This type of waste can be found in every household. However, there isn’t enough UCO to cater to the high global demand, cofounder Tagaddod Nour El Assal says. This shortfall is not due to the lack of people’s love for a juicy piece of fried chicken, but rather because of the lack of a sufficient mechanism to collect UCO from factories, retailers, and households. To solve that gap, Tagaddod built Green Pan, an app that allows households to schedule UCO pickups and another one for hotels, restaurants and cafes — or Horecas for short. The company then exports the UCO to refineries abroad, where it turns into biofuel and hydrogenated vegetable oil — basically the new version of biofuel, from which other types of fuel (jet fuel, diesel, gasoline etc.) can be extracted.
Households and restaurants have certain perks in mind when using Tagaddod. One of the perks of using Tagaddod as a multi-branch restaurant, for instance, is that it helps track each food outlet’s consumption of oil, providing inventory and operational data that is otherwise hard to come by. As a household, every liter of UCO handed to Tagaddod translates into incentives and small gifts.
The start up has been running for almost 5 years
Tagaddod collects UCO from 2k businesses and 40k households, saving approximately 2k tons of emissions a month. The company is targeting reaching a roster of 1 mn households in 2024 and expanding into Africa in the near future.

In Bengali, the word Bondhu means friend and the word Chula means cooking stove. Bondhu Chula is a fuel-efficient, health, environment, and climate-friendly stove. The stove is connected to a long pipe for the smoke produced to be passed in the air outside in such a way that anyone in or outside the kitchen would not be affected by the smoke. In rural areas women often have their children with them when cooking, so the smoke coming from common earthen stoves affects both the mothers and the children. Around 90 percent families in Bangladesh are using ordinary stoves for cooking. The smoke produced from such large number of common stoves lead to 50 thousand premature deaths every year and 2.5 million cases of people suffering from asthma. Moreover, around 60 million tons of firewood is used as fuel in these common stoves every year, leading to extensive forest logging. ‘Bondhu Chula’ will help the people to come out of this scenario and lead a better and healthy life. Source: https://www.thedailystar.net/business/bondhu-chula-healthy-living-1372822 Bangladesh Bondhu Foundation (BONDHU) is conducting Bondhu Chula activities across the country. These activities are part of the development program of the Government of Bangladesh and are instrumental in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The local government is playing an important role in implementing these activities. The local entrepreneurs manufacture and sell the stove and the Bondhu Chula doctors provide the stove installation and after-sales service. Bangladesh Bondhu Foundation is providing one Bondhu Chula per family at a subsidized price. The Bondhu Chula can be used for at least five years with proper maintenance. The advantages of using a Bondhu stove are as follows - (i) Proper use saves more than 50% of fuel; (ii) The kitchen is smoke and pollution-free; (iii) Kitchen tin spoils less; (iv) It takes less time to collect fuel; (v) The kitchen is not covered with soot, and the pots and pans are less dirty; (vi) Reduces deforestation. (vii) Emits at least 1.5 tons less carbon dioxide per year. This reduces the risk of climate change.

The Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS) carried out field research on the impact of Bondhu Chula. Propensity score matching, a quasi-experiment econometric method, was applied using the 2018 household survey data of the BIDS that collected information from 600 users of Bondhu Chula and 396 users of traditional cook stoves. It was found that about 90 per cent of the study households depend on fuelwood for their energy need for cooking, whether they use Bondhu Chula or not. Other fuels used by both groups of households included tree leaves, hay or jute cake, dung and wooden powder. Except for cow dung, the energy consumption was much less among households using Bondhu Chula compared to the households using traditional cook stoves. This indicates the efficiency of Bondhu Chula in terms of fuel need. The efficiency of Bondhu Chula in fuel use was also observed by comparing the energy use of households before and after the installation of Bondhu Chula. The pertinent statistics showed that energy use significantly dropped after the installation of Bondhu Chula. This was observed for all types of fuel used by Bondhu Chula users. From these results, one can conclude that the use of Bondhu Chula significantly lowers biomass energy consumption. One can also infer that this reduction of energy use significantly reduces air pollution and deforestation because 91 per cent of the sampled households used fuelwood for the purpose of cooking and the sources of fuelwood were mainly trees. The results of the econometric exercise show that the impact of Bondhu Chula use on household biomass energy is significant. It was found that the use of Bondhu Chula reduces the per capita biomass fuel consumption on average, with a range of 9.75 kg to 12.25 kg per month. In terms of percentage reduction, this is about 30-37 per cent compared to the amount of biomass fuel used by traditional cook stoves. The laboratory test, as conducted in Bangladesh by the BCSIR, claims that Bondhu Chula saves 50 per cent fuel compared to traditional cook stoves. The difference between claimed fuel reduction and empirically obtained reduction is perhaps due to varying cooking habits practised by the surveyed households. Based on the above findings, the average level of savings in biomass fuel consumption due to the use of Bondhu Chula to be about 11 kg per household member per month, which is about 600 kg per household per year. With more than 29 million households, Bangladesh has a great market potential for Bondhu Chula. With 67 per cent of households using more than one stove, this could increase the total number of stoves to more than 50 million. Taking this potential market into account, the potential fuelwood consumption saving is about 30 million tonnes per year, which is about 51 per cent of the country's total fuelwood consumption. When converting this biomass fuel-saving into the potential reduction of carbon dioxide emission, we obtain that the use of Bondhu Chula would potentially reduce 50.49 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emission per year nationally.

Bondhu Chula users were asked whether the use of the stove reduced indoor air pollution. About 99 per cent of households reported that the use of Bondhu Chula reduced indoor air pollution. The health outcomes in this study are self-reported and measured in terms of the number of eye irritation and the number of respiratory problems a woman suffers per month. For both eye-related and respiratory problems, study results show significant negative effects (i.e., health-improving effects). The results show that women with Bondhu Chula have on average 5.55-6.66 times lower eye irritation compared to the women who use traditional stoves and the same women have on average 0.90-1.28 times lower respiratory problems relative to women who cook using traditional stoves.

After we finished developing the product and had a good performance, we started to do some marketing, like demonstrations and roadshows, to let farmers get to know it. Farmers are very sceptical when it comes to adopting a new product that they have never seen or tried before. Most farmers depend on a referral when it comes to buying or trying something new. We thought we had to go to the market and let farmers see the product working on the ground. This is what happened for several months. At the same time, we gave some farmers that we knew well the chance to try the product for free for a short period. The performance exceeded their expectations; they were very satisfied with the performance and the feasibility of the product.

Ana Gimenez Ponzzoli, Director of Ducha de Sol (Sun Shower) and Community Manager at Mayma.
This is a socio-environmental project which objective is to provide hot water for showers and air heating systems for all types of homes, harnessing the clean and sustainable energy of the sun. To do this, a solar water heater and a solar heater were created, made with recyclable and low-cost materials, which reduce the consumption of traditional fuels and contribute to caring for the environment. In addition, in vulnerable populations, they allow people to obtain hygiene and comfort by providing the possibility of a hot shower and a warm home in winter, which improves self-esteem and social inclusion. 
Prototype system
The project has reached over 500 homes directly and over 5,000 homes through its replication in other provinces and countries. In total, it has spread among approximately 2,000 people. In every case, end users can share their experience and give their opinion. 
With this solar water heater, 70% of the fuel used in conventional water heaters per year can be saved. This implies triple impact actions that avoid more than 70% of greenhouse gas emissions of family origin, which pollute the atmosphere and lead to global warming.

The RedRen 24 initiative (Renewable Network with Storage 24 hours a day) proposes to generate electricity for isolated towns in an innovative way. The system will consist of a 10 kW photovoltaic generator and a 50/80 kW hydraulic turbine. This involves building and kicking off a photovoltaic solar hybrid generation plant with storage by water pumping with hydraulic power generation. The system is complemented by a medium voltage line for the distribution of renewable energy. This project will change the situation of towns that currently have electricity generation limited to a few hours per day, and will allow people to use electrical and electronic devices that are currently very limited, such as televisions, refrigerators, etc. The purpose is to carry out a research project that shows the operation of a power generation plant with solar and hydraulic energy that is perfectly replicable in other regions. All this with the great benefit of not generating greenhouse gases. This makes us deeply proud since we will provide benefits to the inhabitants of the Jujuy puna as well as the environment by using the available energies.
Prototype system
The innovation lies in building a network powered only by renewable energy that will generate the energy needed for four towns 24 hours a day.

The Solar Heating Savings Kit has two pieces of equipment designed by professionals from the EcoAndina Foundation. On the one hand, it has a 100-liter solar collector for domestic hot water, called the “X-Sol 100” solar water heater, and on the other, a “Nina 120” parabolic solar cooker with capacity for a pot of up to 10 liters (8 servings). Both pieces of equipment have an estimated lifespan of 15 years. It was established that the 20 families (from an urban area on the outskirts of the capitals of the provinces of Tucumán and Salta) should be in neighborhoods without natural gas network and in a vulnerable situation, since the purpose is to achieve savings for the families and avoid greenhouse gases emissions, as a result of the combustion of non-renewable energies (such as gas and firewood).

The Solar Heating Savings Kit was distributed among 20 families in an urban area on the outskirts of the capitals of the provinces of Tucumán and Salta.
With the solar equipment installed, the use of fossil energy for cooking and hygiene is reduced by up to 80%, according to the experiences obtained in rural areas by the EcoAndina Foundation.

The Solar Kiosk project’s purpose is to promote solar cooking and show its benefits both for health and family economy, as well as the benefits for the environment as it can reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It consists of a car fully equipped with a Nina 120 solar cooker, removable waterproof roof, gas cooker with a 2 kg kitchen gas container as an energy alternative, conservator, garbage can, organizer drawer, water can, container for washing hands or washing dishes, a kit of black steel pots, 3 advertising boards, a stool and side tables; in addition, it includes the option of a lighting kit. Its function as a self-sustaining enterprise is that users cook with the sun on public roads and sell food. Its implementation is carried out through courses and follow-up in specific events when the Kiosk hits the streets. The challenge is to make this micro-enterprise work in a society that is very used to firewood and gas. In addition, it is intended for cooking healthy recipes with local raw materials, always considering the principles of safety and hygiene in street food sales. The ultimate goal is that each person who needs a solar cooker can get to know it and be encouraged to use it in their home, as this would minimize spending and maximize energy efficiency.

Most of the towns located in the puna are not connected to the national or provincial power grid. In general, they must be autonomous and generate energy with diesel fuel with high costs and the consequent emission of greenhouse gases. Others have generation through photovoltaic microgrids, and the energy is not always enough to cover public lighting in the towns’ access or in their social areas. In general, in the towns, the electrical service is rationalized and limited. Solving the lighting problem in unlit areas of Pueblo Casti and spreading the use of solar technology for clean and efficient lighting are the premises of this project. Photovoltaic equipment will be purchased with the use of LED lights and batteries that enable system autonomy for several days even in the absence of sun.

La Caja Verde consists of a container without electricity that allows to store all the vegetables in a single piece of furniture. This equipment works with water and allelopathy, which is the interaction between vegetables. The system helps keep fruits and vegetables fresh, like they were just picked, for more than two weeks. Hence, the solution makes it possible to take advantage of energy resources by minimizing greenhouse gas emissions, saving money, and to live healthily eating well-preserved food. This solution is ideal for developing areas, where there is no electricity, and where constant and continuous access to electricity is a luxury. It can also be used in humanitarian disasters as a relief resource for people in need. 
Full commercial application
These pieces of furniture preserve vegetables using only the interaction between them, while a refrigerator consumes 64 kWh of electricity to preserve the same amount of fruits and vegetables. In addition, its price is equivalent to a quarter of the price of a regular refrigerator.

This solution consists of an innovative high-efficiency metal stove (rocket combustion system) of 5,000 Kcal which fuel is biomass or organic waste. Externally it has a protective mesh that may or may not have thermal mass; in addition, it vents combustion gases to the outside, making it extremely safe. To empower people and teach them how to build their own eco-stoves from metal waste, manufacturing workshops are held in low-income neighborhoods. The purpose of the eco-stove is not only to heat but also to cook and heat sanitary water. For manufacturing it, only machines and tools used for hobbies are needed, so they are easily accessible.
Full commercial application
The eco-stove consumes the organic waste that accumulates in street corners, such as pruning twigs, cardboard, dry leaves, etc. It is extremely safe, it does not generate fumes or particulates, and it vents the monoxide to the outside which prevents poisoning. Therefore, this device provides heat: SAFELY: Because combustion gases are vented to the outside, which prevents poisoning and death from carbon monoxide inhalation. EFFICIENTLY: Because it has a measured coefficient of performance of 80%, one of the highest available for homes and industries; that is, it makes much better use of fuel. ECONOMICALLY: Because it feeds on small pruning branches, wood waste from crates or scraps, pallets, chipping, leaves and dry compressed grass, etc. Also, because its construction is made with standard materials, most of which can be recovered. SUSTAINABLY: Because it works by burning dry organic waste in a very controlled way, that is, biomass that is renewable energy and very easily accessible.

In south-central Bangladesh, for 300-400 years, people have been following an age-old traditional method of cultivation called dhap, or known locally as baira. These are floating vegetable gardens – artificial islands, that simply rise and fall with the swelling waters. Now farmers are reviving this old practice to reduce their vulnerability due to climate change. Floating gardens are most common in the districts of Gopalganj, Barisal and Pirojpur. Here, during monsoons the farmers gather weeds like water hyacinth or paddy stalks, and place them on stagnant water, beating them into shape and making rafts. They plant seedlings on these organic beds, and place them in flooded parts of the villages. Farmers stack several compact layers of aquatic weeds like water hyacinth, duckweed or paddy stubs – the stubble of what remains after the rice grain has been harvested. They are helped usually by their families and neighbours. The weeds are allowed to rot, and then mixed usually with cow dung and silt. Crop seeds are placed in small balls called tema that are made out of peat soil, and wrapped in coconut fibre. After a week, when seedlings are about 15cm high, they are transplanted to the floating garden beds. Traditionally, seeds of leafy vegetables, like red amaranth, are sown directly on the floating beds. They are then anchored with bamboo poles, so that they don’t drift away. Both men and women work to make these organic floating beds, which last for around five to six months. Farmers grow vegetables like okra, bitter gourd, snake gourd, spinach and brinjal on these beds, and sometimes spices like turmeric and ginger. Besides vegetables, rice seedlings can sometimes be grown. During the monsoon, farmers use small boats to navigate between these small islands. A typical floating bed is about 20ft (6m) long, but they can be as long as 180ft (55m) and provides enough food for the farmer and their family, and a source of income when the surplus is sold. People are experimenting with the materials used to create the floating gardens – sometimes they use rice and wheat stalks, occasionally adding a system of inner tubes made from car tires and a bamboo framework for additional support. The average cost of a floating bed is around 8,000 Bangladeshi taka ($94/£73), making food production possible throughout the year and providing food security even during the monsoons. According to a FAO report, the farmers earn an average profit of $140 per 100 square metres (£107/1,070 sq ft) of floating bed during the monsoon season. According to an FAO report, the production yields are reliable in the floating gardens, such that this system can be the best food production for 60-90% people in the wetlands of southern Bangladesh."

A Bangladeshi conservation organization known as Creative Conservation Alliance (CCA) has devised an innovative and inclusive approach to conservation.

These citizen scientists act as role models for their communities and serve as local conservation ambassadors for the region. ​To date, CCA's parabiologist team has rediscovered several charismatic species previously considered to be extirpated from Bangladesh including: Gaur, leopard, sun bear, Sylhet roofed turtle, Arakan forest turtle, Asian giant tortoise, and even documented the presence of tiger in our study area when traditional surveys from other organizations had failed to do so for years. By utilizing the traditional ecological knowledge of the parabiologists and allowing them to choose optimal survey areas and camera trap locations, it is possible to achieve far more and on a far shorter timescale than would be possible through the strict use of traditional methodologies."

Leonardo Rossi, Co-Founder at Hiliostechs 
This project consisted of the development and manufacture of an electronic device that allows energy from solar panels to be adapted for subsequent injection into the conventional electrical network. The electrical voltage provided by a solar panel has the characteristic of being direct current, so to be injected into the conventional network it must be subjected to a process that converts it into alternating current. The solution is designed for residential users who want to venture into clean energy, reduce electricity costs, and take care of the environment. 
Prototype System
The solution is modular, which implies that it could be complemented with the use of other renewable energies (hydraulic PicoTurbines, windmills, etc.) if necessary. As an advantage, the device allows to reduce the electrical consumption of the conventional network of residential users through the production of energy through photovoltaic panels. The components are inexpensive, and the challenge is achieving identical functionality. The estimated cost is between 500 and 600 US dollars, that is, half of what is paid today in the market for a device with similar features.

Common use spaces are usually areas of great energy waste. Faced with this reality that they had been observing in their own field of work, a team of researchers from the City of La Plata, province of Buenos Aires, Argentina, developed a smart energy saving system. It is a smart system capable of obtaining information on energy consumption in the different sectors of a building with the aim of carrying out actions to save energy. This system was conceived based on Local Intelligent Processing Units (LIPUs) that control different rooms, using a set or network of sensors capable of capturing events in the room (presence of people, temperature, appliance connection, etc.), and based on a set of actuators to control electrical appliances. Each device allows to obtain data from different sensors and generate actions in a certain electronic device. On the other hand, the system facilitates the control of electrical components through relays and infrared waves emitters.

Being a good recipient of solar irradiation, Bangladesh expects to largely harness solar energy source in order to achieve this target. However, installation one MW of solar power plant requires approximately 3.5~4 acres of land. Therefore, land constraint seems to be a challenge for a densely populated country like Bangladesh. Availability of plenty open rooftops may address the space constraint issue for installing solar panels. The Government of Bangladesh has enacted Net Metering Guideline on August 2018 to encourage the use of vacant spaces and rooftops in solar power generation. Infrastructure Development Company Limited (IDCOL) is the pioneer in mass scale off-grid renewable energy dissemination in Bangladesh. Rooftop Solar Project is its latest intervention in renewable energy sector financing. Under this financing scheme IDCOL provides concessionary loan facility, technical compliance monitoring, project development support & performance monitoring support. 
Fully ready
Up to July 2019, IDCOL has approved 11Rooftop Solar Projects of which 4 are already in operation with a cumulative capacity of about 3.07 MWp. IDCOL has a target to finance a total capacity of 300 MWp by 2022. The remaining projects are expected to come into operation shortly.

Compare data with the rest of the world using The Big Microplastic Survey project undertaken by conservation charity Just One Ocean. The purpose of this study is to gather global information on the most frequent microplastics found in the coastal sites of seas, lakes and rivers, to promote comprehensive conservation on the planet. 
Description of citizen participation.Students or anyone interested can participate in the project, and after receiving information or with the coordination of a sampling supervisor, they are in charge of recording the data and analyzing the samples. Following a simple and systematic scientific sampling protocol, they collect information from those plastic items ranging in size from 1 mm to 25 mm found in coastal sites of seas, lakes and rivers, and report the results. Citizens are responsible for classifying samples into primary and secondary microplastics, type and size of plastics, amount and presence of other components (e.g., cigarette butts) in the samples, if any. Samples are collected along the shoreline, parallel to the water. The position (GPS coordinates) of part of the sample, which is recorded as the position, should be captured.

The technique consists in digging a hole in the earth, placing a bed of volcanic rocks, heating them with wood and placing food (meat wrapped in cabbage leaves, potatoes and other tubercules). Then, putting some water to create steam and covering the hole with cloths and earth again. Slow cooking to feed up to 200 people.

Solar based irrigation systems are innovative and environment friendly solution for the agro-based economy of Bangladesh. The program intends to provide irrigation facility to rural off-grid areas. Solar irrigation systems reduce dependency on fossil fuel and demand for electricity from national grid in irrigation seasons. The program also reduces carbon emission and at the same time saves millions in foreign currency. Moreover, the solar irrigation assists farmers by providing cheaper irrigation service compared to diesel-based pumps. Given the immense potential the program aims to install solar PV-based irrigation systems in areas where there are possibilities to produce three types of crops throughout the year, all the while staying safe from flooding, arsenic contamination and saline water. To work towards this end, IDCOL has now set a target of installing 10,000 solar irrigation pumps by 2027.
Up to March 2021,1,515 solar irrigation pumps are operational with an installed capacity of around 40 MWp."

Prospective sellers can access Recycle Jar's website and instantly make their sales. They can also calculate their carbon output using the site's own carbon footprint calculator. To date, the Recycle Jar Ecosystem has increased the income of around 6,000 households while reducing CO2 emissions by 66 tons. They have also redistributed more than 61,000 items. The business model is the sharing economy model in which an entrepreneur is able to execute any selling request by the customers. This model is for the benefit of those customers who do not have time for selling their waste/unused items. This model is appealing to consumers interested in sustainability as well.

Power supply is an ongoing challenge for the telecom operators of Bangladesh as many of the remote areas are not connected to the national grid. In off-grid areas, diesel generators are used to source the required power which requires periodical refueling and frequent maintenance and are subject to fuel price hike. This in turn has forced operators to choose alternative energy solutions, especially solar power. To provide uninterrupted voice and data services, a number of operators have decided to run off-grid BTSs with solar-diesel hybrid power system.

The Puna region is an area of the altiplano with multiple agroecological characteristics and usage capabilities. The main energy source for its inhabitants is plant-based fuel. They collect the scarce firewood available to cook and keep their houses warm. This, along with excessive animal grazing, has a toll on the environment, contributing to damaged and deforested areas that are increasingly exposed to wind and water erosion. In terms of heating, the traditional firewood kitchen is highly inefficient and dangerous. Another consequence of the harsh conditions in the region is water scarcity. Due to the lack of superficial sources, community members resort to manual extraction techniques to access underground water. The constant need for water, not only for domestic use but also for the animal herds, makes the physical labor of it even more considerable. This project seeks to address these problems by embracing the indigenous knowledge latent in their communities and implementing adequate technologies that can improve these families’ well-being and the overall environmental balance. To achieve this, the project entails: the development of hydric infrastructure projects that can provide water to the community through a bombing system to extract, conduct and store underground water; the construction of cost-efficient kitchens that will allow to evacuate smoke, save time and distance collecting fire-wood, and minimize deforestation; and the installation of 2 solar heaters to provide hot water to families for domestic use. Finally, this initiative also will provide training and technical assistance to meet the objective of promoting sustainable, culturally adapted practices and recovering ancestral techniques.

At the moment, the solution has been implemented in the 3 mentioned locations, however the intention is to expand this solution to other communities of the Puna region in the future.

Electrical energy from utility (grid) in Rwanda is expensive and not enough. People do not believe in solar energy technology due to its intermittence. This solution is to connect solar energy to utility using a device called 'RIGHT LAMP AUTOMATIC CHANGEOVER SWITCH'. The solar energy use is the priority source of energy. From this, electrical energy use will be enough as users are to generate their own electricity. The PV-Grid system reduces electricity price between 80% to 100% and Rwandans will be able to cook using electricity which is the strongest solution to environment degradation.
50,000 FRW/KW equivalent to 52$
The YouTube video below captures the end user feedback. 
The system saves between 80% and 100% of electricity price. During the innovator's thesis, he used the prototype on one electrical shop as a sample. The results revealed that 97.5% of energy from solar was used meaning that the energy tariff reduced by 97.5% in that shop.

Avec un taux d'électrification estimé à 28% au niveau national et à 3% en zone rurale en 2018, les possibilités de production énergétique sont très limitées dans les zones rurales. La principale source d'énergie disponible pour les populations rurales est la main d'oeuvre humaine aujourd'hui réduite essentiellement au travail des femmes et des hommes. Le bois énergie est également la principale source d'énergie pour la cuisson. En termes d'énergie productive, l'utilisation de l'énergie solaire se limitait souvent au pompage de l'eau et à la réfrigération pour la conservation de divers aliments et boissons. La mécanisation dans les champs, lorsqu'elle est disponible, est principalement assurée par des tracteurs dont l'accès, en raison du coût élevé, est limité aux grands agriculteurs et aux coopératives. Par ailleurs, la transformation des produits agricoles est effectuée par des prestataires de services qui utilisent des moteurs à combustibles fossiles. C'est pour y remédier que le Rural Energy Assistant (REA) a été développé. C'est une plateforme d'énergie mobile alimentée par l'énergie solaire qui peut être conduite au champ et aider à labourer, semer et irriguer les cultures et ainsi réduire la charge de travail des agriculteurs. Il peut alimenter d'autres appareils tels que des appareils de cuisson, des petits concasseurs, des moulins, etc. pour des activités génératrices de revenus. Outre l'utilisation productive, le REA peut alimenter n'importe quel appareil à faible consommation d'énergie.

Flores Clemente, President of the Indigenous Community “El Angosto” 
In the Puna region, climate conditions are known to be harsh (with a cold-dry climate, wide thermal amplitude, intense winds and water scarcity), and many times exacerbated by human intervention related to excessive animal grazing and the exploitation of natural resources such as intense consumption of firewood. This is usually done in inefficient structures like open-air kitchens, holes in kitchen floors or clay ovens. These traditional cooking techniques entail an important use of the already scarce firewood, given its low heat efficiency. Apart from this, the amount of smoke they produce has a detrimental impact on women's health, who are typically the ones working in these kitchens. Given this situation, this project aims to incorporate appropriate technology into these communities by building ecological ovens and kitchens, installing solar heaters, and building a Trombe wall. Firstly, the new kitchens will allow to release cooking smoke efficiently and safely and will avoid families from taking the long walk in search of firewood. It also will allow reducing deforestation. Secondly, solar heaters will take advantage of solar energy to provide families with hot water for hygiene purposes and other uses. Finally, Trombe walls allow keeping a comfortable temperature inside the home. The construction of a first Trombe wall will be used as a pilot experience to then be replicated in other communities. Additionally, the project will provide training workshops to boost an active participation from the community. These workshops will contribute to developing habits and attitudes that can contribute to a healthy lifestyle when it comes to renewable energies. The goal is to give value once again to the ancient wisdom of the community in the management of natural resources and to strengthen the territorial governance of the organization.

This solution seeks to address the scarcity of firewood in a deteriorated ecosystem due to deforestation. Its inhabitants suffer lung and smoke-related eye diseases because some foods (corn, beans, etc.) require several hours of fire cooking. The foundation accompanies communities by offering workshops on ecological kitchen construction. Participants assemble these kitchens and ovens using simple tools (hammers, riveters) and recycled material (brick, adobe). These smoke-free kitchens implement efficient systems in the use of firewood for cooking, baking, and heating water.

The “El Potrero” finca, department of Iruya, in the province of Salta, Argentina, is characterized by its semiarid mountain weather. Low temperatures are common during winter, falling as low as -15 °C (5 °F), and the thermal amplitude is quite wide throughout the whole year, as higher temperatures reach 20 °C (68 °F). However, solar radiation is very heavy and continuous in the area. One of the communities living there, Las Capillas, comprises 12 families, from which most of the men have height jobs, far from their town and their families. Weather conditions in the area are a problem for women in the community when washing clothes and bathing their children as water is too cold, even frozen. In summer, to heat water, they leave buckets out in the sun for hours, and during the winter water needs to be heated using firewood or guano bricks. This issue prevents some daily tasks to be performed, but it also has health consequences, such as problems with hand articulations, respiratory tract conditions in children who are exposed to cold, or poor regular hygiene to avoid the cold. Besides, the laundry task has traditionally been a social activity. Laundry was done in the river, where women could talk, exchange information, and plan different activities. Nowadays, a great amount of landslide material has changed the river course due to floods, blocking the water flow. The result is families washing their clothes at home. Although women claim a hot water supply for their houses, they still acknowledge the benefits of community laundry as it makes social exchanges possible. Based on this issue, the solution includes creating a community laundry space with hot water using solar energy by means of leveraging the high levels of solar radiation in the area. The community laundry space have a big pool filled with water. The effect of solar radiation magnifies through upper and lower thermal insulation material to change water temperature according to its use. This solution provides the community with hot water for laundry, cooking, and personal hygiene. By doing so, an issue that affects the community’s life quality is tackled and, at the same time, health conditions can be avoided. It also contributes to environmental sustainability through practices using solar energy, economic sustainability due to low prices and material durability, and a sense of community through the laundry space. 
Prototype system
This solution was difused in four communities: Las Capillas, San Isidro, San Juan and Chiyayoc.
There will not only be hot water for washing clothes but also for cooking and personal hygiene in a place where conventional energy is almost inaccessible to its inhabitants. The installation of durable and proven solar equipment is difficult but feasible in this type of community, located in isolated areas, even with low budgets such as the one available in this project.

Experts built a passive thermal device to preserve food, and installed it in a rural household in the suburbs of Bariloche. The house is made of wood and it has thermal insulated double walls in mud and straw. It is plugged to the grid but with limited electrical power, therefore it has sought a reduction in electric consumption. The cooler has wooden structure and insulated walls of expanded polystyrene. The heat is transferred to the cold exterior through a metal surface, which can also be insulated on and off by an external door. The mounting of the device was finished and sealed with mud and straw to match the house ́s architecture. 
Prototype system
The device was built and installed in the house in January 2009 and was systematically tested between March and August of the same year. The results show a great potential for passive cooling in Bariloche, Río Negro, Argentina, for at least 6 months of the year. Starting in May, and estimated until the end of September, the cooler can be considered a very similar alternative to a regular refrigerator, and the period of use can be extended for two more months by adapting the storage of food to average temperatures of about 10°C.

In Bangladesh, access to water is a severe challenge for the indigenous communities in the Chattogram Hill Tracts (CHT), who primarily depend on natural sources such as waterfalls, creeks, hill streams and other bodies for drinking and household use. These water sources are diminishing rapidly, primarily due to deforestation. As a result, the communities are increasingly facing water shortages ever year especially during the dry season. The women and children are the worst sufferers as they are assigned to collect water for their families. They have to travel far from their village to fetch water, and in some areas, they spend almost half a day in search for water. Time spent collecting water means less time for work and education for the adults and the children. To tackle this issue, the UNDP Bangladesh Accelerator Lab, in collaboration with local grassroots organization Creative Conservation Alliance, is deploying a solution - HYDRAM or hydraulic ramp pump system - in a remote village of CHT to generate learning on whether the model works. Hydram is a relatively low cost, low-maintenance water pumping system capable of lifting water up to 600 vertical feet from the water source to the village up the hill. This pump uses the natural power of water flowing downhill to lift the water and doesn’t require any external energy sources or electricity to operate, and hence is environmentally sustainable. The villagers can use the water for drinking, domestic chores and even for irrigation to grow crops during the dry season.

Engineers, field technicians, students and teachers from the Liceo Agrícola Secondary School collaborated on the practical implementation of solar energy to complement traditional energies for cooking and preserving food. The Lavalle branch of the National Institute of Agricultural Technology (INTA) has donated a solar furnace to the community of the School of the National University of Cuyo (UNCUYO) as part of a training focused on the use of a metal container-type solar furnace, an alternative with a wooden box and a fruit and vegetable indirect dryer. The session began with the presentation of the solar equipment in the esplanade. Then, food was prepared for cooking, and vegetables, fruits and aromatic herbs were prepared for drying. Subsequently, the topic of renewable natural energies was addressed, focusing on solar energy and the construction of furnaces and dryers

Eric Barney, profesor at the School of Engineering and leader of the educational and community pilot unit for the development of renewable energies
The goal of developing these pilot experiences is to visibly state the differences between the merely productive approaches that encourage the construction of mega-dams and the social approaches where the center and purpose of the actions are oriented towards improving the quality of life of the inhabitants. The aim of the project is to solve the electricity deficit in protected rural areas in a novel way. In its execution, no polluting or toxic elements are used, nor is the forest destroyed nor are electromagnetic fields that pose a health risk created. Mr. Barney, who is an engineer, together with students from the School of Engineering and local settlers, carried out a pilot experience with a 1 kW test turbine. They used a Michell Banki turbine, model T-12 modified by the Misiones Renewable Energy Group (GERM) and built by a metallurgical workshop in Oberá, Misiones, under the direction of another engineer called Barney. The net jump height used was 5 meters, at a flow rate of 30 liters per second.
Prototype system
The power obtained in the test was 1 kW, which meets the forecast, and it indicates that the estimated results will be obtained for the equipment that is planned to be installed. The experience made it possible to refute the performance values that are estimated in the calculations for the determination of the useful power that can be extracted from hydraulic use. In this sense, the project on the Trigueriño stream could have contributed a total of 12 kW, as discussed in previous paragraphs; however, to avoid using all the natural flow of the water course and because it is a prototype project for educational and demonstration purposes, equipment was installed to obtain 3 kW of power, which will adequately satisfy the demand described.

The purpose of this solution is to address lack of clean cooking energy in Rwanda where more than 90% of households still rely on polluting traditional biomass-based cooking like firewood and charcoal. These inefficient cooking methods reduce the country’s forest cover, generate indoor air pollution that causes respiratory diseases associated with 1.6 million deaths globally every year and together with decomposing organic wastes dumped in landfills generates greenhouse gases contributing to climate instability
500,000 FRW / 515$
(TRL.6), the solution has a functional prototype.
A market research was conducted and it showed that at least 50 households, that is 85% liked the product and showed willingness to pay for it.
Compared to existing clean cooking energy solutions like biogas system, this solution is cheaper with the cost reduction of about 40%-70% of traditional biogas system.

Traditional oil-press is altered using a jack to assist in oil pressing, reducing workload and time. Sekiu oil is traditionally used to flavour food. It is extracted from the seeds of Sekiu tree (Madhuca motleyana), which fruits only once every few years. To make sekiu oil, the traditional method would be to place the materials in between two logs, and clamp the logs together to press out the oil. This traditional oil-press is called 'kepisen', or 'ales', and is operated manually by hammering the logs together. As the gap between the logs closes, the sekiu, placed in the bag, is pressed and oil is extracted as a result. Alteration has been made to the oil-press with a hydraulic jack with manual winch that replaces the need for hammering. The force from the jack substitutes manual hammering, reducing workload and manpower, as well as time in operating the 'kepisen'."

The Problem:
Farmers who use greenhouses are faced with challenges that come with the cold season. Farming in winter is so expensive due to the scarcity and high prices of fuel and the long hour's electricity cuts. 

The solutions:
Using large amounts of manure as an eco-friendly alternative source of energy to heat the greenhouses. The manure released carbon dioxide and nitrogen which increase the temperature of the greenhouses. 
The design:
The solution depends on the fermentation and composting process that produces heat, this heat is then distributed evenly in the greenhouse using hot air passages installed in the greenhouse. 
Green house building and installation costs 3000$, (in Syria it is more expensive due to scarcity of inputs, and due to economic sanctions)
Composting heating distribution unite costs: 1200$

With the plant in operation, the company undertook the conversion of the plant to a hybrid photovoltaic system - batteries - diesel engines, a project that culminated in June 2019 with the start of the supply of clean energy to the community, leaving the engines as a source of backup power. The project was executed with co-financing from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), through Loan Contract No. 3692/OC-PN ""Innovation Program for Social Inclusion and Productivity"", having been the Company benefited by the Program of Promotion of Research and Development of the National Secretariat of Science, Technology and Innovation (SENACYT).
Proven implementation of product, service or process at scale
It is the first example of a hybrid micro-grid in Panama that combines fossil fuels with a photovoltaic energy.

Profile Innovator, Mr. Naseem Ahmad Kanchan hails from the Mau district of the Uttar Pradesh. Innovator has observed that there is lots of polythene waste in our surrounding area and it is polluted the environment. Keep in mind all things, He decided to modify the stove in polythene waste can be used as a fuel. Purpose The innovator designed a stove in which heat is produced by burning the polythene waste and dry powder. Technical details In this innovation, the small cylindrical bowl is placed inside the mainframe of the stove where dry powdered fuel is mixed with the liquid obtaining after the burning of polythene. The inside structure consists of two net breakers and the lower side has two holes in the opposite direction. Plastic pieces are placed on the first breaker and burn it. After burning it liquifies and reaches the second breaker where it mixes with a dry powder to form a paste. It is maintaining the heat for cooking the foods. If heat is required to control, a pipe can be connected to the hole made on the lower side and the pipe can be partially closed and opened for this purpose. Benefits This stove emits less carbon, the raw material is cheap and easily available, it can be assembled or disassembled and it is used for efficient cooking food in less time.

In Quito (Ecuador) there are approximately 700,000 vehicles that travel daily through the streets and avenues of the city, resulting in high rates of GHG emissions and chaotic traffic (it is estimated that the average occupancy of private cars is 1.2 users/car ). The ""Carona, shared mobility"" initiative seeks, in its first stage, to discourage the use of private cars and promote shared mobility through an application where it is possible to ""match"" between the routes of each person. In this way, it is intended that there is no longer practically 1 person per vehicle and the use of streets is optimized as well as generating community and interaction between inhabitants of the surrounding areas (neighborhoods, housing complexes, parishes, valleys, etc.)"

In Ecuador, as in other parts of the world, once the harvest is done, the rice straw is left in the field and weeks later, when it is dry, it is burned, causing high CO2 emissions. It is a problem for the farmers, neighbors when the burning is carried out, for the environment and society. Rice staw is a good insulating and Yes Innovation explored the fibers for bioconstruction, creating panels for construction. Like all natural fibers, they have a positive behavior against humidity, they receive it and evacuate it easily, which glass wool does not support. Also, this biomaterial is resistant to fungi and small animals, because it is a fiber that has a lot of silicon, it is very hard, so it is not very pleasant for small mice or for fungi. In addition to this, compaction means that it does not catch fire quickly. It is like wood, which takes a long time to burn, and finally, it is recycable.
They ranked 21st among the 500 best in the Green Latin America Awards 2019 and, in addition, the Roi Baudouin Foundation of Belgium agreed to support the project and will finance a good part of the development. Also, they won the environmental distinction of the municipality of Quito last year.

Stoves having three chambers connected in parallel are available in art; Astra stove (Jagdish K.S.2004, The development and dissemination of efficient domestic cook stoves and other devices in Karnataka Current Science 87(7):pp. 926-931). But these chambers are connected horizontally.In this case, the stove consists of two chambers, each with a burner for cooking, and a geyser for heating water. Both burners can be used simultaneously, saving time and using the heat effectively. The heating chambers are oriented at different levels in order to be able to completely utilise the heat energy produced connected to a chimney, which provides part of the draft.Inside the main chamber, mud has been used as insulating material to retain the heat. There are air vents on the sides of the first chamber to allow cooling of stove so that it is not too hot to touch for the women/men using it.Bharatbhai is working further on the stove and wants to add another chamber (which can be utilized for steam cooking). He wants to fine tune its thermal effeciency, reduceassembly?s weight and cost by making stove body with GI sheet. He envisages building versions with different burner attachments.While he has sold more than three-dozen units of the current model locally, he is planning to launch commercial versions having two burners with geyser and one burner with geyser.

Jyothi Ravishankar
Kanara, Karnataka
Jyothi Ravishankar, a 33-year-old housewife and a mother of two children, hails from Madar village in the South Canara district of Karnataka. She has a degree in Law, but she is not a practicing lawyer. She lives in a joint family of seven members. Jyothi has received ample encouragement from her husband and family members to pursue her innovation. During her spare time Jyothi pursues her hobbies such as sketching, painting and stitching. Genesis As a child Jyothi had observed that, while cooking on the traditional hearth, which is still prevalent in most houses in the southern parts of our country, nearly 50% of heat was being wasted and it gets unbearably hot near the hearth. Firewood being a non-renewable source of energy, she thought of developing some manner of using this heat energy that is being wasted. Her resolution was strengthened by the fact that it is also very difficult to procure enough supply of firewood, especially for the poor. This formed a perfect backdrop for the birth of the idea and she designed this stove, which would help save fuel as well as prevent wastage of heat. In the process of developing her innovation, she encountered some difficulties. She was not able to get the cooperation from the mechanics at the workshop when she sought their help for building her stove and she had to run around a lot to get things done. Jyothi has installed this modified stove unit in her kitchen along with five meters of plumbing to connect the hot water to the tank in an adjacent room to work as a (non-electric) geyser and has been using it successfully for the last three years. Word has spread regarding her innovation. This is a multipurpose energy efficient utility stove which captures the wasted radiated heat in a wood fired stove to simultaneously cook as well as heat water in a tall drum to a temperature of 80 degrees. The unit works on the principle that cold water flows down and hot water rises up. The arrangement consists of a stainless steel enclosure-envelope on three sides of a wood fired stove and two pipes which are connected to the stove. These pipes are connected to the pipes from the boiler in the bathroom. Cold water comes in from the bottom inlet pipe, gets heated and passes out of the hot water pipes to go and fill a stainless steel hot water container. A separate tap is attached to the hot water pipe on the side of the oven to collect mugs of hot water for making tea, coffee. While food gets cooked in the oven, the cold water flows in, gets heated and fills in from the top into the tall drum placed on a stool behind the stove. In two hours up to 150 liters of hot water at 80 degree centigrade is made available in the drum. The entire unit is portable and can be set up anywhere. NIF has sanctioned Jyothi Ravishankar a sum of Rs.5, 625 from the Micro Venture Innovation Fund for making prototype to conduct market survey of the Stove cum Water Heater. Advantage The novelty of the device lies in the fact that with the same source of heat two functions can be performed simultaneously- for example cooking and heating water in the boiler. There is efficient energy utilization of burnt wooden fuel-stock. The cost is around Rs. 1000 because the water chamber of the stove is made of stainless steel to prevent rusting. It has a wide potential in rural homes where gas cylinders are too expensive, not available or where the supply is erratic. A housewife with a difference... Jyothi’s aim in life is to spend a happy and contented life with her family. At the same time, she is no ordinary housewife, but one with a difference. She has proved that along with being a mother and shouldering the responsibilities of home and family, there is a lot that one can do to contribute to save the environment. She believes that this two-in-one stove of hers will definitely be useful to society and especially to the poor farmer because after a hard day’s work toiling in the field, he would definitely welcome a hot water bath and that too without spending any extra fuel and with the added benefit of enjoying a hot meal. Satisfied with the good response she got from local people and institutions she is motivated to innovate further. She specially remembers with gratitude the efforts of noted littérateur and writer, Shri. P.Ramakrishna Shasthri who brought her work into the limelight. Finally she says about herself “Though I have a degree in law, I am a contented housewife now. But in future I would like to work or do some kind of business and put my education to good use.”

Niranjan Prasad Sharma
Pilibhit, Uttar Pradesh
Niranjan Prasad Sharma (43) hails from Khudaganj, Pilibhit, in Uttar Pradesh. He has studied up to the 8th standard. He is married and has four sons and a daughter. His sons are studying in school and his daughter has completed her B.A. He owns a house and a shop in Pilibhit. A stove repairing mechanic, he earns his livelihood mainly through the business of manufacturing furnace stoves. He earns Rs. 36000 per annum. He also has a keen interest in painting. Genesis He got the inspiration for developing the innovation by observing the kerosene lantern, which is widely used in villages. He faced a lot of difficulties in procuring the raw materials for developing the innovation and arranging finances. Niranjan Prasad admits that in his pursuit of developing this stove, he was neither helped by his family nor anyone else. It was his own strong determination that kept him going. At the same time, he remembers with gratitude the help given by the Bank Manager of Bank of Baroda, Pilibhit. Niranjan is quite interested in starting a business of his own with this innovation for which he expects the initial investment to be around two lakhs rupees. This stove is based on the principle of kerosene atomization. The key concept is that of pre-heating the kerosene flowing in from the cylinder thereby converting it into gaseous form. It is then fed into the burner to give a clear blue flame without any smoke, sound or deposition of carbonaceous soot on the cooking vessel. The heating is achieved through a delivery pipe fitted above the flame. NIF in coordination with the GIANs has sanctioned an amount of Rs. 37, 250 from its Micro Venture Incubation Fund for prototype development for market research for the improved kerosene stove and three other innovations. Advantages This innovation enables higher combustion of kerosene. It consumes 25% less kerosene and burns with a blue flame thus eliminating smoke. In addition as no soot deposits on the bottom of the cooking vessel it removes the drudgery of cleaning the soot filled cooking vessels. Scientific bent of mind... From his early childhood, Niranjan had a keen interest towards science. His foray into innovations included tinkering with several useful devices such as kerosene gas burner, dosa maker, diesel burner as well as small machinery like combustion engines, valves, pistons etc. This kerosene gas burner consumes 200 ml oil per hour. It is less noisy and due to the presence of rotating burners, there is less accumulation of carbon. The dosa burner’s plate is made of copper and has eight pores in it. It shows less deposition of carbon and burns with a blue flame. The diesel burner utilizes both water and diesel. A special chamber is made over the burner, from the corner of which passes a small pipe which is used for pouring drops of water over the plate. The water is poured onto it drop by drop and it liberates more energy in the form of steam. Apart from the above innovations, he has also designed a diesel furnace, a snack dryer and a heavy-duty cloth dryer.

Maibam Deben Singh
Bishenpur, Manipur
This is a wood charcoal-fuelled cooking stove with several drying trays below the gas top, to dry various food items. The stove is a self-standing one, which also serves as doubling as a workplace having a work platform at a height of 75 cm from the ground and measuring around 60 cm x 90 cm. Two cooking stoves have been provided at the top and a third one for drying purposes at the bottom in the center. The stove emits very less smoke and also dries the food items effectively. As the entire system is made in galvanized sheet metal/aluminum, upon use it gets warm and dissipates the heat to the surrounding, keeping the room warm as well. The stove has been tested at IIIT, Manipur, Imphal where the system was found to be more efficient than available charcoal burning chulha. This is possible because the air used to burn the charcoal comes through the enclosed box, where it gets preheated. So some part of waste heat gets recovered and hence the efficiency of the cooking stove cum dryer is about 10 % more than the conventional system. The air intake to the stove is regulated through a proper vent system and depending upon the type of food cooked can enhance the fire or reduce the burning of the fuel. For ease of circulation, a small fan has also been incorporated into the system. IIT Manipur has suggested modifications to the cooking stove cum dryer to make it more efficient and user-friendly. Over the years Deben Singh has participated in and displayed his stoves and dryers in several exhibitions and fairs at state, regional, and national levels. He has also received several awards for his contribution to the development of useful technologies and skill development. Recently, the Department of Commerce and Industries, Govt. of Manipur has allotted him a permanent work shed at an Industrial Area in Imphal where he would now get an uninterrupted power supply, which will help him scale up his production. NIF has also supported him through its business development grant and recently through the Micro Venture Innovation Fund (MVIF) for scaling up his business. Their rights to his Innovative fish dryer and Emoinu stove have also been acquired under Grassroots Technological Innovation Acquisition Fund (GTIAF) by NIF for wider diffusion. Deben Singh is also planning to impart skill development training to interested local youth so that they can work with him or start their enterprise.

Jorhat, Assam
Purpose: Most people in rural areas of Assam have been facing various difficulties in the cooking meal at their kitchen. Generally, firewood is being used as a primary source of fuel. However, due to ignorance and also by adaptive culture, a huge amount of heat energy goes waste during cooking. The innovator Khanindra came up with an idea of developing a tool with which the problem can be solved by sustainable utilization of the energy where heat can be restored and he succeeded to develop this stove after many trials. Technical details: This is a bi-chambered innovative bio-stove separated by a metallic circular plate from one chamber to the other, The upper chamber is meant for putting fuel source in it. A dome-shaped metallic burner with an opening on the top is being placed on the upper fuel chamber which checks the airflow from outer surroundings. Then the stove is placed above the burner. Above the whole arrangement, a circular metallic plate is placed that protects the heat release from the firewood. Once the fire sets than other bioresources such as cow dung, unused wood materials, etc. are added into the existing fuel resources. This bio-stove has the provision of temperature control and this is achieved by using various setup combinations and also by air control regulator provided beneath the combustion chamber. The lower chamber is meant for collecting ashes released from the burnt biomaterial. The size and shape of the burners vary and can be used according to need. Benefits: The stove has some novel features which can be advantageous in terms of working efficiency as well as better cooking control with air regulation arrangement and various attachments."

Mr. S. J. Joe
Kozhikode (Calicut), Kerala
Purpose In the conventional stoves available in the market, both fuel and energy liberated from it are lost in a various manner. Mr. Joe developed an innovative stove model to achieve a higher ratio between energy utilized and energy released (Combustion ratio). Technical details The system consists of a burner (nozzle-78), boiler, water storage vessel, steam cooking vessel, water regulator, tubings connecting vessel, Insulating materials, asbestos sheets, glass wool, etc. Burner: The burner is same as conventional one, but it is located 8 cm below the top of the stove. It is centrally placed at the left half of the stove. Boiler: Boiler is a ring-shaped chamber and is located right above the burner with its inner wall surrounding the air space above the burner. The boiler is equipped with a number of copper tubes, which stick into the container space from the inner brass wall of the boiler. The inside ends of copper tubes are closed water tight and outer ends are opened. This arrangement ensures better and uniform heat transmission into the water body kept in the boiler. Also, the top surface of the boiler is tapered to confirm with the flow pattern of the flame facilitating direct contact with it. Water storage vessel: Conical shape 9 cm high tapering from 8 cm to 4 cm made of steel. This is connected to the boiler bottom through the copper tube with a regulator fixed in between. This is placed at the centre of the stove. Steam cooking vessel: A 21 cm diameter, 11.5 cm high vessel made of steel centrally placed at the right half of the stove. A stream outlet from the boiler is fixed at his bottom with a nozzle arrangement. Water regulator: This is fixed at the right side of the stove. It regulates water input to the boiler. Tubings: Water vessels and boiler are connected with the copper tubes. The copper tube connecting boiler top and the cooking vessel is insulated with asbestos rope. Insulating materials: The boiler is insulated by asbestos sheets. The steam outlet tube is insulated by asbestos rope. The cooking vessel is insulated by 2 cm thick layer of glass wool surrounding it. Working: The fuel gas from the burner burns off as it goes upward. As the flame reaches the bottom surface of the vessel above almost complete combustion of the fuel would takes place. The extra heat generated by better and usual heat loss (radiation, convection) would be absorbed by the boiler and steam is produced from it. The steam formed at the top of the boiler is then taken to the cooking vessel using insulated copper tubes. In this vessel, steam-based cooking can be done. i.e., to make IDLIES it would take only 6 to 8 minutes. Water supply to the boiler can be regulated depending on cooking requirements. Thus along with regular cooking steam-based cooking can also be done without using extra fuel. Arrangements for tapping boiled water for making TEA, COFFEE, etc. can also be made. Benefits It is cost-effective as well as fuel-efficient stove. The steam generation initiates within 10 minutes of lighting the burner.

Jyothi Ravishankar
Dakshina Kannada, Karnataka,India
Profile Innovator Mrs. Jyothi Ravishankar, a housewife and a mother of two children, hails from Madar village in the South Canara district of Karnataka. She has a degree in Law, but she is not a practicing lawyer. She lives in a joint family of seven members. Jyothi has received ample encouragement from her husband and family members to pursue her innovation. During her spare time, Jyothi pursues her hobbies such as sketching, painting, and stitching. Purpose in childhood, Mrs. Jyothi had observed that, while cooking on the traditional hearth, which is still prevalent in most houses in the southern parts of our country, nearly 50% of heat was being wasted and it gets unbearably hot near the hearth. Firewood being a non-renewable source of energy, she thought of developing some manner of using this heat energy that is being wasted. Her resolution was strengthened by the fact that it is also very difficult to procure enough supplies of firewood, especially for the poor. This formed a perfect backdrop for the birth of the idea and she designed this stove, which would help save fuel as well as prevent wastage of heat. In the process of developing her innovation, she encountered some difficulties. She was not able to get the cooperation from the mechanics at the workshop when she sought their help for building her stove and she had to run around a lot to get things done. Innovation detailsMrs. Jyothi has installed this modified stove unit in her kitchen along with five meters of plumbing to connect the hot water to the tank in an adjacent room to work as a (non-electric) geyser and has been using it successfully for the last three years. Word has spread regarding her innovation. This is a multipurpose energy-efficient utility stove which captures the wasted radiated heat in a wood-fired stove to simultaneously cook as well as heat water in a tall drum to a temperature of 80 degrees. The unit works on the principle that cold water flows down and hot water rises up. The arrangement consists of a stainless steel enclosure-envelope on three sides of a wood-fired stove and two pipes that are connected to the stove. These pipes are connected to the pipes from the boiler in the bathroom. Coldwater comes in from the bottom inlet pipe, gets heated and passes out of the hot water pipes to go and fill a stainless steel hot water container. A separate tap is attached to the hot water pipe on the side of the oven to collect mugs of hot water for making tea, coffee. While food gets cooked in the oven, the cold water flows in, gets heated and fills in from the top into the tall drum placed on a stool behind the stove. In two hours up to 150 liters of hot water at 80-degree centigrade is made available in the drum. The entire unit is portable and can be set up anywhere. NIF has sanctioned Jyothi Ravishankar a sum of Rs.5, 625 from the Micro Venture Innovation Fund for making a prototype to conduct market survey of the Stove cum Water Heater. Benefits The novelty of the device lies in the fact that with the same source of heat two functions can be performed simultaneously- for example, cooking and heating water in the boiler. There is efficient energy utilization of burnt wooden fuel-stock. The cost is around Rs. 1000 because the water chamber of the stove is made of stainless steel to prevent rusting. It has a wide potential in rural homes where gas cylinders are too expensive, not available or where the supply is erratic.

Bharatbhai Agrawat
Junagadh, Gujarat,India
Profile Background Bharat Agrawal (40) has innovated a multipurpose wood stove with two burners at different elevations that can efficiently run using both, wood and coal as fuel. He has studied up to class tenth and has been running agricultural equipment. workshop for the past 25 years. His family consists of his father (who is an innovator himself and a national awardee of NIF), grandmother, wife and three children. His father, Amrutbhai was a Pujari in the temple, began his life as a farmworker after discontinuing his studies in the fifth class. He had set up a small farm machinery workshop. Later he also started making iron doors, boxes for granaries and iron gates. Bharat started helping his father since he was in the sixth standard. He is an environmentalist and understands the need for utilizing natural resources to generate energy in an efficient and eco-friendly way to power different applications. This was also tested by GEDA, Vadodara. This bent of mind has influenced his choice of innovations to be developed. Energy optimization has been a constant focus of all his endeavours such as the present one-the modified wood stove. Purpose Traditional wood stoves, by virtue of their design, do not optimally use the heat generated and also emit much smoke and pollutants due to incomplete combustion. Bharatbhai fitted an exhaust chute to a wood stove and noticed that a lot of heat was still coming out, which made him infer that the non-utilization of heat was the major fault in existing wood stoves. He decided to solve the problem by facilitating better heat utilization through sufficient air supply and a correct channel for burning. To improve it further, he developed a mechanism for the simultaneous heating of multiple vessels using the same heat source. Bharatbhai made the first model of this stove in 1999, then after a few modifications, he came up with this multipurpose stove, which two multilevel burners and a single fuel feeding point. Innovation Among various innovations of his, only one dealing with a cooking stove is taken up for elaboration. Technical Details Stoves having three chambers connected in parallel are available in art; Astra stove (Jagdish K.S.2004, The development, and dissemination of efficient domestic cookstoves and other devices in Karnataka Current Science 87(7): pp. 926-931). But these chambers are connected horizontally. In this case, the stove consists of two chambers, each with a burner for cooking, and a geyser for heating water. Both burners can be used simultaneously, saving time and using the heat effectively. The heating chambers are oriented at different levels in order to be able to completely utilize the heat energy produced connected to a chimney, which provides part of the draft. Inside the main chamber, mud has been used as an insulating material to retain the heat. There are air vents on the sides of the first chamber to allow cooling of the stove so that it is not too hot to touch for the women/men using it. Bharatbhai is working further on the stove and wants to add another chamber (which can be utilized for steam cooking). Does he want to fine-tune its thermal efficiency, reduce assembly weight and cost by making a stove body with the GI sheet. He envisages building versions with different burner attachments. While he has sold more than three-dozen units of the current model locally, he is planning to launch commercial versions having two burners with geyser and one burner with geyser. The conveyor comprises a set of chains; it can cut 4” deep at a time and takes about two minutes to fill an 11 ft x 6 ft x 2.25 ft size trailer. It can fit in any tractor of 50 hp and above. While using this machine, the tractor consumes about five to six litres of diesel in an hour. The machine has a cutting width of 4 ft and sand is dropped from a height of 8.5 ft height. Benefits This product may have considerable social impact and commercial potential.

Profile Innovator Mr. Gh Nabi Khan belongs to Baramulla district of Jammu & Kashmir. He runs a workshop named Khan Steel & Metal Works at Wagoora village. HE designs various types of items like boxes, fodder trays for animals, brazier and allied items. Purpose Brazier locally called Bukhari in Kashmir is traditionally used as heater in Kashmir during the harsh winters in homes, offices across the valley to maintain the room temperature. It is typically a wood-burning stove. Bukhari consist of a wide cylindrical fire- chamber at the base in which wood, charcoal is burned & a narrower cylinder on the top that helps in heating the room & acts as a chimney. The base of a Kashmiri Bukhari is wider than that of the most western wood-burning stoves. During winters there is a frequent power cut in Kashmir, especially in rural areas. To overcome this problem, and to get protection from cold air the innovator thinks of this innovation. Technical details Mr. Gh Nabi has developed a brazier having two chambers. The lower chamber has a usual fire inlet where wood or charcoal is placed for burning. A long chimney is attached to the right of a barrier to vent out smoke outside the house. In order to keep the fire burning inside the brazier an air vent is carved on the other side of the brazier. The upper chamber is an empty vessel contains water having an inlet for pouring water. As the fire is lit in the lower chamber of the brazier the water container upper side gets steamed. The innovator has specially developed the innovation for winter purposes in Kashmir. A pipe attached with a tap is attached to the water tank to have hot water. Benefits The modified brazier gives heat in the room and simultaneously it steams water during winters to have hot water. This saves energy and time to get water steamed separately. An ideal tool for rural areas having very fewer facilities available during winters. This acts as a water boiler and heater of room.

Yes the solution is affiliated with an institution in Cameroon -Energy Solutions for All (ESA Services)
10 years ago, women and girls in rural areas of Cameroon's Far North region were barely 2 km away to get wood for cooking meals. Today they are at least 15km. This strong pressure on forest cover is causing deforestation and the degradation of forest ecosystems, which in turn exacerbates the vulnerability of populations to the effects of climate change. Our solution is to offer an alternative fuel to the use of wood energy. Indeed, we recover organic waste (rice husk, millet stalk, corn stalk, cotton stalk, peanut shell...) in order to produce ecological charcoal which is an environmentally friendly fuel and meets the seventh objective of sustainable development (SDG 7). Our goal in the next two years is to replicate the solution in the North Cameroon region and the Adamawa region. Indeed, the problem of waste management is common in our communities and this solution that we propose is part of a logic of waste recovery for the proper management of waste.
We sell a kilogram at 150cfa compared to that of wood whose prices vary from 300cfa to 500frs sometimes. The wood in the city of Maroua is sold in a small pile of about 03 twigs which is up to 100frs and can not make a meal
TRL 5- TRL 6
The product is in demand by households and restaurants in the city of Maroua who appreciate very well the cooking time of the product as well as its very reduced price. Currently about 500 kg of the product is requested per day.
500 kg of the product is requested per day. A small amount of our product can be used to cook large amounts or more food for longer than regular charcoal or charcoal from other sources that usually burn faster and the consistency of the heat is not the same.
Our main challenge now is that of communication around our product. Also we are still battling for the recognition of our product by the Agency for Quality and Standard Control

The reason Fish Aggregating Devices work is simple: 
""Fish are fascinated with floating objects. They use them to mark locations for mating activities. They aggregate in considerable numbers around floating objects""
To these fads we will attach satellite driven technology that will give us a lot of information about the fish movement etc but also about the ocean itself.
The FADS will be used to increase fish catch for fisherfolk and to attract and maintain pelagic fish stock in the area, these include Amber Fish, Bonito, Dolphin (Mahi Mahi), Marlin, Rainbow Runners, Skipjack, Swordfish, Tuna, Turpics, and Wahoo (Kingfish).

There are vulnerable communities that lack public lighting, which causes problems such as insecurity, lack of community social cohesion, theft of animals, among others. By implementing light poles that work with solar energy, access routes to communities and recreational places such as parks, schools, community houses are illuminated. This initiative also brings internet to communities, and the solution is being explored.
Improve led light so that it has a greater scope of spectrum and illumination

Oui ETS SOLAR ECOBAT est enregistré. Voici son numéro de NIF et registre de commerce
Problème : Le problème que nous essayons de résoudre est la pénurie de l’électricité et l’accès à l’eau dans les zones rurales en Mauritanie ou 87 % de cette population n’a pas l’accès à l’électricité. Et également la lutte contre les feux de brousse causés le plus souvent par l’utilisation des bougies ou des lampes à pétroles et leur remplacement par des lampes solaires. Solution: Solar- Ecobat est une entreprise dans le domaine d'énergie solaire créée par une jeune femme ingénieure écoénergétique et basée à Nouakchott. Nous réalisons des études et installations de kits solaires autonomes pour électrification et pompage solaire en milieu rural principalement.
Le coût unitaire dépend du besoin du client si c’est dans le domaine d’irrigation cela dépend de la superficie du champ à irriguer et le type de culture. Pour électrification cela dépend du besoin dans la maison, centre ou autres ça peut aller de 25 000 à des 680 000 pour 15kw installer voir plus selon la demande.
Elle est operationelle
La solution a été bien diffusée sur les réseau sociaux (fecebook notre page solar ecobat, youtube en RFI aussi; jai fais une émission sur les 7 milliards de voisins).

Para sus directivos, lo más importante es que la empresa brinde un servicio a la comunidad en general de recolección de desechos metálicos que sirva como complemento de la conservación del ambiente, para lo que se requiere que el acopio de la chatarra fluya dentro y fuera de nuestro territorio, en donde se pueda brindar el mismo servicio.

ECOCA Digital Solar Powered Cooker - Ruth Komuntale
Nsambya, Uganda
Uganda National Alliance on Clean Cooking (UNACC)
The ECOCA is a compact, self-contained, multi-purpose home cooking unit, run by solar energy. It is to be imagined as a fully working kitchen, which can provide an entire family in a rural area with food and electricity throughout the whole day. It consists of an electric base, which includes a battery pack, a solar panel array, and a highly insulated cooking pot that can keep food warm for hours. ECOCA came in to solve the deforestation problem in the refugee settlement. It won the grant to design the solution. It is housed at CARITAS Uganda, as this made it easy for project coordination of the projects being run by the organization in the refugee settlements. The ECOCA is the world’s first off-grid solar energy cooker is powered by a 275 watts panel that harvests energy from the sun. It consists of a 400W pot with an underneath heater. The pot is a double insulated pan which saves over 89% of energy. The cooking set also comes with 3 Led lamps with USB ports, 5-meter-long cables, a movable solar light, and a portable torch. The whole system is designed in Denmark under the Pesitho company. Manufacturing of parts is done in China and assembling is done in Uganda. The stove has 3 cooking levels in which; Level 1- For warming food Level 2- For cooking soft foods Level 3- For cooking hard or longer cooking foods. The pot has sensors to lower heat and conserve energy facilitated by an inbuilt thermostat. Food cannot get burnt. The ECOCA currently has 3 versions. The first version failed to cook beans and subsequently, there has been an improved version.

The following ECOCA units have already been installed and in use: * 500 in Bidibidi refugee settlement under the Pesitho, ECOCA East Africa, Caritas Denmark and Caritas Uganda partnership; *60 in Kyangwali under the Pesitho/Ecoca East Africa, Care Denmark and Care Uganda; *100 in Rakai with Community Integrated Development Initiative (CIDI); * Another 225 in Bidibidi refugee settlement with the Mercy Corps partnership; another *An additional 50 units at CIDI for the commercial market; and * 230 units in Malawi under the World Food Program partnership. Beneficiaries of the ECOCA are always excited to give feedback on the technology and some of their testimonies have been referred to in the link below.

FUNDACION PROMAR es una organización ambientalista panameña, sin fines de lucro, formada por voluntarios deseosos de participar en la conservación de los ecosistemas marino costeros.
La Fundación PROMAR nació en la ciudad de Panamá el 3 de junio de 1991, como resultado de un proceso de reacción de los grupos de buceo panameños a los cambios negativos que se observaban en los ambientes marinos.
Los miembros fundadores de esta organización fueron el Club Panameño de Buceo Deportivo, el almacén Buzo y el almacén Scuba Panamá, de los cuales solo el último aún existe.
Sin embargo, con posterioridad, nuevos miembros, muchos de ellos no buzos, se sumaron a este esfuerzo que, en todo momento, se mantuvo en un bajo perfil a fin de no sobre dimensionar sus estructuras y mantener el nivel de voluntariado existente.

Remar iniciamos un proyecto de RECICLAJE, (plástico, papel, cartón y vidrio), en nuestra sede en Chilibre, lugar donde se encuentra la mayoría de la población que recibimos en internado. 
El proyecto RECICLAMANIA nace de la necesidad de cumplir de forma parcial con varios objetivos que creemos que son fundamentales para seguir mejorando nuestro programa de Rehabilitación de personas, que es nuestro fin. Uno de los objetivos es generar trabajo de terapia ocupacional para que la mayoría de los internos que tratamos pueda desarrollar como parte del programa de rehabilitación formándose y preparándose para la reinserción.
Reciclamanía también nos da la oportunidad de contribuir con el medio ambiente, recuperando materiales contaminantes que en otro caso ocuparían espacio en los rellenos sanitarios y contribuimos a que los recursos limitados de nuestro planeta sean mejor aprovechados.
Este proyecto también se crea con la intención de generar recursos económicos para la institución y es ahora un pilar importante en el financiamiento de la obra, dándonos así la posibilidad de ampliar cupos, mejorar la atención a los beneficiarios, las instalaciones, crear otros talleres de formación y ocupación ( proyecto cristales ), etc.

Global waste production is one of the main contributors to global warming. In addition, soil pollution by means of fertilizers is another contributor because they degrade not only the land and the air but also the crops and the nutritional quality of individuals. Since half of the daily produced waste is organic, this solution promotes a model design that uses organic waste for the production of biogas and biofertilizers, and it can be replicated in different establishments that produce and sell agroecological fruits and vegetables.
The initiative suggests two lines of action to implement in the horticultural facility “De la Pacha”. The first one involves developing a biodigester—a hermetically sealed container—to be filled with organic waste and water, and then inoculated with methanogenic bacteria which decompose matter. The decomposition of organic matter within the container produces methane, which can be used as an electrical power source. The second line of action involves using digestates—the material remaining after the anaerobic digestion—as biofertilizers to improve soil quality and productivity.
Prototype system
This system is a solution that, through the first line of action (methane production in biodigesters), diminishes losses caused by product manipulation and reduces the consumption of gas cylinders . On the other hand, the second line of action (biofertilizer production and use) enables working with fertile soil, which contributes to crop resistance and health under adverse conditions, and minimizes the use of external supplies to offset food damage. The reduction of external supplies not only benefits crop quality but also blocks the release of gasses that harm the atmosphere.

Co-created project: Citizens participate in all stages of the scientific process
Overall goal: Contribute to disaster risk reduction associated with hydro-meteorological events, through dialogue with territorial stakeholders in order to improve the community early warning system focused on the population. Specific goals: Identify hydro-meteorological monitoring and forecasting needs for the sectors involved. Improve communication, dissemination and interpretation mechanisms for forecasts and alerts. Create a space for permanent joint knowledge building between the academic-scientific sector and the community, as a strategy for social ownership of information about hydro-meteorological events in a given territory.
Description of citizen participation The activities include dialogue and community development of vulnerability and exposure maps describing how water moves in the territory, either due to the overflowing of rivers and streams, and/or rainfall affecting the neighborhoods located along the riverbanks. Prior to the workshop, the scientific-technical sector investigates the issues in each neighborhood to identify characteristics that help explain the water risks. During the workshop, the community is asked to transfer all their knowledge about water risks on a map or a high-resolution photo of their neighborhood. In addition, a tour of the neighborhood is organized in order to identify possible sites where the rain gauge and the level ruler will be installed in a nearby river or stream easily accessible so that observations can be recorded at all times. Community leaders send photos of each device at relevant moments, which are then used to analyze the information during possible flood events. Subsequently, in a final stage, the knowledge is consolidated in a single geo-referenced map that is used by the scientific-technical sector and the community. Thus, parties are involved in the construction of an early warning system.

Develop and disseminate natural history biological approaches on each species present in the Puna and on aquatic ecosystems. Specific goals: Monitor the invasion of exotic fish in the Puna. Assess the importance of fish for local communities and for Indigenous Peoples in the Puna.
Description of citizen participation Citizens are responsible for: 1- Surveying in the field various natural pools and geothermal springs with the names provided by citizens and translated into geo-referenced data. 2- Categorizing these sites according to water usage (agricultural-livestock, domestic, etc.). 3- Identifying springs with and without fish using illustrated species guides. 4- Loading the information into a database using different fields, such as town, coordinates, fish species and density, date and time, environmental characteristics, and water usage. In this way, the local population will help to gain a real understanding of the distribution and natural history of the fish in the Puna. This knowledge will not only be a valuable scientific contribution from a different perspective but will also be a tool for the people of the Puna to argue in the future, based on hard data, about the impact caused by certain anthropogenic activities and, in particular, inadequately regulated extractive activities. In addition, it will eventually be possible to relate them to global climate change, especially in these fragile high-altitude wetland ecosystems whose aquifers depend on glacier water contributions during spring and summer.

Collaborative project: Citizens participate in data collection and analysis.
Overall goal: Articulate an extension practice that strengthens open collaboration in the study of everyday phenomena and research, among researchers and citizens, especially youth. Measure environmental noise in different areas of the province of Tucumán that help determine the degree of noise pollution of the environment in which people develop their activities. Identify the level of noise in school and health environments to raise awareness of how much it can impact the health of people and animals, among other others. Specific: Promote a scientific and collaborative analysis of the environment of activities such as teaching and health to identify noise pollution and then expand the scope of study. Develop the ability to make the results obtained through research available to the community. Encourage the interpretation of the data collected and generate the appropriate space for discussion and exchange of ideas among different actors. Train for the presentation of reports to public agencies in charge of environmental decision-making and impact on society, such as municipal and provincial governments. Promote collaboration with other organizations, networks, and associations to monitor and care for the Tucumán environment. Make an approach to the cultural identity of the region from a sound perspective, that is, to identify those sounds that are typical of the region (from birdsong to business noises), in order to integrate sound to the urbanistic view of an area.
Description of citizen participation This is a proposal and part of it is in process, so some steps may change depending on previous studies. Measurements First, students from primary and secondary schools discuss, analyze, and conduct a noise pollution measurement protocol organized by researchers from the National University of Tucumán. The measurements will be conducted with cell phone applications suitable for this purpose that allow measuring sound levels and geolocation. Once the measurement is generated, the data is uploaded to a map that displays the data on a web page. The information is completed with a survey of the population of the study area (problematic areas from the point of view of noise in the microcenter of Tucumán, which will allow a first approach to the design) invited to participate through a web page. With the data obtained, students from secondary schools in the province participate in a first analysis. The proposal begins with the participation of students from high schools in the province of Tucumán and then will be offered to the community in general. After the entire process, a report will be prepared and presented to university and municipal authorities. If the participating citizens assess that the problem is serious (based on available legislation, for example), the process of proposing solutions at the municipal level begins.

El presente proyecto espera fortalecer los procesos existentes de comunicación (interna/externa) y organización de las comunidades Buglé, Ngäbe, Bokota y campesinas en el Caribe panameño, desde el río Cahuita, en la Comarca Ngäbe-Bugle, hasta el río Belén, en el norte de la provincia de Veraguas, con la intención de producir y difundir información relativa tanto a la prevención y atención de la pandemia ocasionada por la COVID-19 como a la gobernanza y seguridad territorial. Por consiguiente, el proyecto involucra también un fuerte componente de formación, de transferencia horizontal de conocimiento tecnológico, en lo que respecta al uso de las nuevas tecnologías de la información y la comunicación (TIC), elaboración de productos comunicativos audiovisuales y digitales, entre otros, con la intención de sostener una red de comunicadores comunitarios, que puedan estar organizados y activos no sólo para la difusión de información relativa a la prevención y atención de la pandemia, sino al paso nacional siguiente que será la vacunación de la población. Es fundamental apuntalar los propios mecanismos locales de comunicación, que definitivamente ya existen, que consisten en intercambios y visitas itinerantes de los líderes y autoridades por todo el territorio, pero que debido a la pandemia y las medidas de restricción a la movilidad se vieron afectados. Es importante también que la población de las comunidades, los grupos de mujeres organizadas y líderes tengan suficiente acceso a la información, tanto acerca de lo que acontece en el territorio, sobre el conocimiento y estrategias propias en cuanto a la atención de la pandemia, como a lo que sucede fuera de allí y les impacta en sus vidas cotidianas y gobernanza territorial.

For people from low-income households, access to financing is a deep-rooted problem related to a low level of financial soundness and, in most cases, their precarious and/or temporary access to the labor market. This means that they are, mostly, in the informal sector of the economy. In this context, people use extraordinary subsidies provided by the state’s social welfare system as a means of capitalization and/or financing. This is due to the extraordinary nature of these funds, how they represent an otherwise inaccessible large sum of money for families, and the fact that they are not to be returned. Because they are not perceived as a regular income of the household economy, they are perceived and managed differently. In this case, to start a new economic activity. For instance, the Emergency Family Income (IFE, by its initials in Spanish) was repeatedly used as an individual financing strategy during the pandemic (investment capital) for new ventures such as, for example, the purchase and sale of products and/or food. It was also used to make collective purchases in which groups of people get together to lower costs or to constitute a common fund. This was a widely seen strategy during the “Mujeres en red” (Women in Network) Solutions Mapping, where we interviewed women from low-income areas in regard to their solutions to face the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. According to one of their testimonies: “We spent the first aid because we didn't think they were going to give it again. We bought merchandise, everything. Afterwards, the second time, I told my husband ‘Why don't we invest, or do something?’. He told me ‘Well, go ahead’. So, we bought clothes and he went to pick them up for me. He also did the deliveries for me.” Interview #49 young women from “Mujeres en red: soluciones financieras y de recuperación socioeconómica” (Women in Network: Financial and Socioeconomic Recovery Solutions). People who benefit from this type of money transfer policy use the amount of money received for a long-term project or economic activity that exceeds the survival or more formal expectations of the intended policy. This is why this type of strategy can be referred to as “policy reappropriation”. When these transfers are done consistently, families come to consider the amounts as an available sum of their domestic economy. Extraordinary transfers can have a bigger impact on these households, as their unexpected nature turns them into available capital that can be invested to carry out small businesses or home construction/renovations.

The Ndinda Chiefdom is one of the most degraded areas characterized by large gullies. Due to the rainfall in the past season and deep soils in the area, the gully has expanded causing rampant erosion in the area. Therefore, the purpose of the solution is to solve the challenges of erosion. ACDP development with the support of UNDP revealed the challenges of SLM issues as the main ones. The solution was a result of the needs identified as part of the Chiefdom development process. This was the biggest danger which needed machinery as the problem is a result of poor drainage. The focus here was also aimed for skills transfer as the project involves local labour from the community. The aim is to also fence the place for environmental benefits such as planting of fruit trees and grass to create the necessary ground cover to prevent further erosion.

The Nano club is a student-led initiative under the King Abdullah Institute for Nanotechnology at King Saud University. Faisal Alsubaie was one of the leaders of the club who has graduated since from the department of chemistry while Malik Alhalees and Saleh Aldeligan are in their first-year medical students. The Nano club promotes scientific research, projects, advocacy and awareness on Nano Technology. The students’ initiative stemmed from the Saudi and Middle East Green Initiative as they started thinking about the environmental state in the Kingdom in terms of its hot arid weather as well as soil conditions and irrigation efficiency.
They started searching for solutions that would suit the context by preserving water in the soil in terms of materials. While exploring different materials, they realized that some products are commercially available and currently being used, but they have some limitations. As an example, when decomposed they produce toxic materials. The students came across cellulose which is one of the plant cells' constituents that can be extracted and utilized for different uses. Cellulose is a well-exploited material and has many commercial applications such as manufacturing of papers, cotton, as well as foods and drugs preservants. Also, cellulose is a hydrophilic material meaning a material that has a high affinity for water, in addition to it having no negative impacts on the environment or humans' biosystem. The approach they have been using for fabricating cellulose-based water preserver products is safe, easily accessible in markets, and environmentally friendly. It has a 75% efficacy in terms of food grade. They had mentioned that the final product and production process is very simple that it could be done and tested in someone’s backyard.
This solution kind of solution is being implemented globally by other innovators in different regions depending on the local materials. The students started experimenting with palm tree branches which are one of the most locally available agricultural wastes. They clarified that they are not the first to use this material but what they are aiming is to be differentiated by producing a cost efficient, ecofriendly product as other similar functions found are petroleum based. By doing so, they can recycle agriculture and organic waste (such as fruits and potatoes) promoting a better environmental ecosystem. Through this initiative, they are utilizing the local waste and creating valuable products."

During a recent visit accelerator lab made to FishTech hatchery in Patuakhali, an innovative hatchery solution was identified that could be beneficial in large scale. These mechanisms involved lab testing, water quality testing, micro-scoping observation, pcr lab. They are also the first to introduce Zero feed in Bangladesh for rearing Golda shrimp. Creating Specific Pathogen Tolerant Variety (SPT) Fish: Because of virus infestation, 82 hatcheries in Bangladesh were shut down. It was advised from the authority to create Specific Pathogen Tolerant Variety (SPF). However, SPF cannot be created in the first try, and requires the mother fish to go through the domestication process. So, Fishtech (BD) Limited started the domestication process. A research pond was required to start the process. Availability of pond and opposition created by the pond owners delayed the whole process as the idea of bringing fish from 4-5 rivers was opposed. The fish must be parent fish, which needs to be cross bred to create F1, F2, F3, F4 generation of fish. The F4 generation becomes Specific Pathogen Tolerant Variety (SPT). The was in collaboration with WinRock and World Fish. Virus identification was done by Bangladesh Fish Research Center and Bagherhat Shrimp Center. Last year (2021) F1 generation was created with fish collected from 4 different rivers. They pla to start netting the F2 generation."

1. The accelerator lab Bangladesh focused on community-based tourism as a viable pathway to achieve economic empowerment through employment generation. UNDP Bangladesh has previously focused on conservation of endangered species in the Sundarbans, a key challenge to which is unsustainable tourism. To ensure the biodiversity conservation and promote responsible tourism in the Sundarbans, the lab identified ecotourism as a potential solution. One of the grassroots organizations working in this space that the lab identified is the local environmental organization Bangladesh Environment and Development Society (BEDS) in Khulna, which is implementing an innovative community-based tourism initiative for promoting sustainable livelihoods and conservation of the Sundarbans. BEDS’ ecotourism site focuses on community-based tourism carried out by the locals. The community maintains organic farms and uses them to feed visitors traditional meals of crab, shrimp, and fish. Performance troupes offer song and dance and local shops offer visitors their pick of handmade wall hangings, embroidered cushion covers and other local crafted items. The purchases also help to support the local economy, reducing the communities’ over-reliance on the forest’s resources. To further reduce dependence on the Sundarbans’ resources, BEDS conducted skill development training, selecting women from 100 families and training them handicrafts based on the biodiversity of the Sundarbans (tablecloths, bed sheets, pillow covers, handbags, key rings, handkerchiefs, vanity bags, etc.) which they can sell to tourists. BEDS has developed its own brand Banojibi agro farms, under which various food items such as rice, oil and pickle are being produced by the locals. BEDS has also undertaken nature education for the forest dwellers by creating interactive and engaging communication products such as board games showing different parts of Sundarbans and biodiversity maps showing flora and fauna. These materials can also be used to educate tourists and promote ecotourism."

Education System in Iraq Amid COVID-19, The Challenges:
E-learning signal started emerging in Iraq after the spread of COVID-19 in April 2020; this is actually a tremendous window of opportunity to strengthen the Iraqi education system. In Iraq, the education system is largely focused on offline teaching tools. The incorporation of e-learning will support digital skills of teachers and students, more efficient and effective teaching methods, and the suitability of youth to the digital job market. When COVID-19 hit the world, restrictions related to the coronavirus pandemic have disturbed education systems all around the world. In Iraq specifically, all learning has moved online suddenly and without prior notice. This affected mainly the way the material is being delivered and the assessment methods. Hence, this required a quick intervention from the eco-system enablers (UNDP Accelerator Lab Iraq) to induce structural changes to the education system through introducing blended learning.
The Solution, Blended Learning Teaching Methods Curriculum:
Seventeen Iraqi experts from the higher education system worked together to tackle the above challenge with the support of the UNDP Accelerator Lab Iraq and in partnership with the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research by writing the first from its kind teaching methods curriculum ""the Blended Learning Teaching Methods Curriculum"" for seven specializations; Administrative, Medical & Health Sciences, Engineering, Educational, Humanities, Agricultural and Veterinary, Scientific.). The Blended Learning Teaching Methods Curriculum upskills higher educational professionals to adopt new technological skills and encourage a hybrid mode of learning, combining online learning with on-campus learning. It is the first of its kind in Iraq, and the newly-developed curriculum is officially rolled out across 35 Iraqi universities to serve more than 50,000 academic staff.
This newly developed local curriculum is the first of its kind in Iraq, and is officially adopted by the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research and rolled out across 35 Iraqi universities to serve more than 50,000 academic staff.

Did you know that you can eat your coffee's cup? 🥤 Plastic waste from the food and beverage industry is occurring in large quantities every day, which is a global waste issue. However, at present, a group of change maker in Lao PDR came up with a creative and a tasty products. ☕ ""Eat your cup"" is a product from a Lao youth that aims to create a change in the consumption of coffee in an environmentally friendly way. Latdavanh or ""Marina"", a Lao youth who is only 18 years old, makes ""eat your cup"" and won the 2nd runner-up prize in the Toyota Incubation Program in 2022. 🍪Marina invented this edible cup by using ingredients like chocolate cookies and green tea, which are all plant-based ingredients, without using eggs or butter, so that everyone can eat it, whether they are vegan or vegetarian. This cup is able to receive hot drinks up to 100c and cold up to -20c for a period not less than 1 hour. The good thing about using an edible cup is that you can drink your favorite drink and still eat the cookie later. In addition to filling the stomach, it also helps reduce the amount of waste that may be made from toxic materials such as plastic. 🌎 Also, Marina is a young person who likes and is obsessed with doing business for the society and is also a volunteer of the Zero Waste Laos, an organization that works on raising awareness about environment. Also, ""Eat your cup"" was born from Marina's experience when she went to study in Japan, where one day her Japanese sister took her to make plant-based cookies and it was a delicious cake. Marina came back to adjust the recipe and experimented with it until it became an edible cookie cup. 🍪Currently, Marina herself is developing a recipe to overcome various limitations and aims to release ""eat your cup"" soon so that her customers can try it and enjoy a delicious cup with their favorite coffee. The long-term goal of ""eat your cup"" is certainly to preserve the good environment. But in addition, she also set the goal of sharing the profits in future youth development projects.

In the pursuit of automation in the oil palm industry, the harvesting collection process of oil palm remains largely unresolved as current research in automation would not yield a robot that is as efficient as a human operated tractor. This is due to the lack of research in time-varying kinematics, something a human can be easily trained to do but has not been successfully replicated in robotics.
This project aims to create a custom algorithm, a time varying kinematic solver with a ""reflected"" trajectory predictor, that when combined with supplementary algorithms, will create a robot that is able to collect object goals automatically - without stopping in its movement. This would replicate the efficiency and efficacy of human operated tractors in the oil palm industry.

Why do we hire first? Because we want to show that we are serious about them. A lot of the youth feel demotivated when they need to go through months of training without getting any paid. The first thing that they need is to survive. So with this, we give them confidence that we are serious about them.
During this time too, we could analyse their strength and weakness and identify which part they could improve or what can they learn in order for them to earn.

""Koondos"" is a Kadazan word for ""Happy"".
Koondos! is a brand managed by Moyog Innovation house (MIH) with the support from PACOS Trust and TONIBUNG to help the rural areas community in Sabah affected economically by the pandemic to market their products and produces online.
Sabah is a state full of resources, with a variety of local products to be enjoyed by our consumers, including handicraft, ginger, honey, vegetables, fish, rice and many more. Most of the communities in the rural areas make a living by selling produces scavenged from the forest, handicraft or through farming activities. Due to the pandemic, the earning capability of the villagers has been severely limited by the restriction of movement to sell their produces at Tamu (local farmers market).
The implementing partner is positioned to assist the villagers in selling their products online by providing education and training to them on basic e-commerce application, marketing strategies and methods to increase product value.
The implementing partner hopes to improve the quality of the life for the rural communities by empowering them with adequate knowledge, tools and infrastructure to build a more resilient economy through digitalisation, in response to the current COVID-19 pandemic and in preparation for future crisis.
This initiative hopes to provide the community and their children with equal access to opportunities in livelihood and other basic human rights and close the gap on inequitable outcomes."

CRUSH-IT is a machine designed to crush recyclable items like plastic bottles and aluminium tins. Users can use the machine's touchscreen display to choose the type of item that needs to be crushed. When the plastic bottle or aluminium tin is crushed, a mechanical presser in the machine will flatten the item for storage inside the machine. This is a more economic method because it involves lower travelling distance and transportation costs to collect recyclable waste. This technique can also minimise carbon emissions from the waste. 
Operating based on Internet of Things (IoT), the Crush-It machine not only detects the total collection but can also send notifications to the collector to inform that the machine is full. A text message will be sent with the phrase 'TONG PENUH' (translated as 'full bin'). The user can also access data and download the data into a USB drive. 
One additional feature is that there is a dump bin prepared on the side of the machine to enable users to insert bottle caps and collecting rack to hold plastic cups and used cup covers. The machine also comes with a panel display for commercial advertisement purposes."

Tree stump removal works is a global issue whereby the stumps that are not removed completely can cause accidents, tarnish the scenery and increases the difficulty in planting new tree plants. For example, in 2014, a motorbike rider became victim to a tree stump after hitting it. There have been various methods that remove tree stumps that involve the use of machineries that are costly. However, the operation of the machineries also require high costs. To overcome this, the Legendary Group, composed of officers in the National Landscape Department and Hulu Selangor Municipal Council, took the initiative to create STUMP-NO-MORE. STUMP-NO-MORE functions as a stump remover. The equipment is made from recycled materials such as drum tin, scrap metal and used items easily obtained and of low value. Based on the portable concept, the equipment is easy to be moved from one place to another, requiring only 2 handlers. Using STUMP-NO-MORE saves up to 80% of operating costs compared to conventional tree stump removal techniques. The equipment completely and cleanly removes tree stumps, leaving behind an ash-filled hole that can be refilled with soil and then flattened. The hole left behind can be used to plant new plants, easing the landscaping process at an effective cost. This innovation is patented with the Intellectual Property Corporation of Malaysia (MYIPO)."

The Smart Evacuation Plan (S.E.P.) is the brainchild by the group One Step, of the Kuala Lumpur Fire and Rescue Department Malaysia. This was a project that entered the Department's internal innovation competition in 2020. 
The project is inspired by the rise in fire incidents such as the fire incident at Hospital Sultanah Aminah in Johor Bahru on 25th October 2016 that saw 6 casualties because the victims were trapped in the building. The accident was a departure point for the Setapak Fire Department to increase their service delivery for the year 2018. The One Step group was hence created. 
Post-mortem discussion of the fire incident suggested that ineffective Fire Training was a contributing factor to the fire. This caused the following reasons: failure of fire warning system, lack of preparedness by building occupiers towards fire incidents, physical obstruction at fire exits, late action by the emergency response team, and inadequate handling of the fire by the response team. 
The S.E.P. was born from the need to improve the efficacy of disaster management for fire incidents. The S.E.P. is an innovative and cost effective online integrated system with multiple functions to:
(a) access building evacuation guide online
(b) contact the nearest Fire and Rescue Department without dialling
(c) contact other Fire and Rescue Department, hospitals and safety agencies without dialling.
The S.E.P. works through the building occupiers' smartphones. It is activated through scanning the S.E.P. 's QR code that is placed at strategic locations in the building. On the interface, the user only has to press the icon Fire Exit Plan to access the evacuation guideline with animated directions. Pressing the Fire Station icon allows dialling to the nearest fire department, while the Emergency icon connects to other fire departments and safety agencies."

Specific goals: Create wildlife corridors in all the towns of the Escobar district and add the community’s gardens with native plants in an online collaborative map with georeferencing, photos, and descriptions - Improve large spaces of biodiversity and pollinators’ capacity to pollinate the big municipal agroecological vegetable gardens of the district. 
Description of citizen participation: Citizen participation consists of many tasks. Citizens receive training every month on topics related to wildlife corridors, native species, and environmental restoration. Citizen participation also consists of seed collection and exchange among neighbors for the creation of seedlings in different garden centers of native species around Escobar. In the same way, butterfly gardens and tiny native forests are created in the public squares of the district, the port of Escobar on the Paraná Delta, and every sidewalk where there are urban trees. By taking part in these activities organized by the municipality, citizens can take the following things to their homes: seedlings they made from native plants, butterfly shelters with native plants, native trees, seeds for agroecological gardening, aromatic plants for insects, compost made with pruning waste done at the municipality, pots made with processed ecobricks, or plantable pencils, that is, everything allowing citizens to grow and take care of species at their gardens at home. Thus, another instance of citizen participation involves identifying and georeferencing native species at private home gardens, contributing to the creation of a collaborative map on which urban wildlife corridors are rebuilt.

We go on different tracks that include all parts of the Kingdom, north, south, east and west. Our paths are available to everyone and are diverse, as they include: community tourism, eco-tourism, cultural tourism, as well as accessible tourism - tourism for people with disabilities - it is our right to see Jordan through the eyes of a path and be able to know the identity of the land. The land always has a story that expresses who lives and passes through it. Our story is told by the souls of its participants. In each path, we exchange new experiences from everyone who joins us and the Masar family, and our story is completed by getting to know the people of the areas we visit, which are forgotten or unknown places to discover hidden stories. A path that includes: a walk in a new place, a new attachment to the customs and traditions of the inhabitants of the regions, a more adherence to the homeland. We climb the mountains through the valleys to see the magic of nature and the beauty of spring in the north of the country. We contemplate the stars of the sky and walk on the sand in the desert. We venture and defy the obstacles in the water valleys in the Jordan Valley. Each of us has a different vision and a different spirit, we hope with a path to spread and share a comprehensive vision of the concept of tourism and land

AI Sentencing System is a machine learning-based system developed by Sarawak Information Systems Sdn. Bhd. (SAINS), in collaboration with the High Courts of Sabah and Sarawak, to generate sentence recommendations in court cases. This is an initiative to reduce sentencing discrepancies in court cases for similar offences. 
The system works by giving out sentence recommendations, but it does not mean that it is the AI system that passes the sentence. Instead, it provides the magistrate with a benchmark based on past sentencing trends across all the courts. The power to make a final sentence decision remains within the discretion of the magistrate. By making the sentencing process more consistent across courts in different locations, AI sentencing can support a more equitable justice system the public can believe in. AiCOS (AI Court Sentencing) is currently deployed for possession of scheduled drugs, an offence under section 12(2) punishable. 
The use of AI Sentencing System is increasing as magistrates become more familiar with the process and observe the outcomes. Over time, as a majority of magistrates adhere to the recommended baseline, this innovation will help to synchronise common grounds among the magistrates thus promoting consistency in sentencing. In the long run, it is expected to increase effectiveness and transparency in the delivery of justice."

Mr Lim Chee Hwa has the mindset to combat dengue in Malaysia and hopefully around the globe one day after meeting an entomologist who had an idea to create a project such as the AedesTech Mosquito Home System (AMHS) to contain the spread of Aedes mosquitos. AedesTech is an invention that reduces the population of aedes mosquitos in the effort to reduce the number of dengue cases. It also can be used as a surveillance and monitoring tool. Designed to be placed anywhere, it has been proven to reduce 75% of dengue cases and 50% of labour costs. Its specialty also lies in a chemical liquid used in the device itself. Aedestech functions as a tool to control Aedes mosquitos and it also utilises 4IR technologies. As Aedes mosquitos are attracted to the trap to lay their eggs, the life span of those hatched eggs will be shortened. They would not be able to make it to its adult stage, which in turn helps combat the spread of dengue. Not only that, because Aedes mosquitos do not lay their eggs in one place, they most certainly would travel elsewhere and at the same time lay their eggs there as well. When they do leave the trap, they would carry along with them the chemical liquid which has been implanted on them, and that is how they are able to contain the spread of dengue; by auto dissemination. The chemicals used in the trap is non-toxic and non-hazardous. It is in fact safe for human ingestion (though not recommended). It also offers 24/7 protection and one only needs to refill the chemical liquid in the machine once a month."

Pn Aizah started MADcash when COVID-19 hit Malaysia. MADCash, which stands for Multiply, Assist and Donate Cash is a platform that allows donors to channel their money to B40 women entrepreneurs launching new businesses. The donated funds are used as loans of between RM1,000 to RM2,000 which is treated as a perpetual cash fund. MADCash also raises a separate fund to run an entrepreneurship development programme that equips these women to strengthen their businesses. Through the MADCash programme, women receive the benefits of mentorship and training by the Academy of Women Entrepreneurs to learn the ins and outs of running a business. “Instead of giving your money to charity, donate it to MADCash, impact lives and track who your funds are helping at any one time.” Pn Aizah pitches this idea to banks, foundations, NGOs and the CSR arm of corporate organisations for them to help women become financially and digitally included. As the women entrepreneurs pay back their nointerest loans within 10 months, this money is upcycled to another woman. Pn Aizah stresses that MADCash is not a bank and does not operate like one. MADCash is straightforward, which gives her the edge compared to other micro-loans programmes. MADCash follows the Islamic Social Finance Model. Another aspect of the MADCash programme that sets it apart is that it is a holistic support system. The women in the programme may also experience difficulties in personal areas. Because of this, Aizah says that “everything needs to work as a whole” and that “we know that women need support in other parts of their lives as well, if only they have someone to talk to"

To date, Bateriku.com has helped train almost a thousand B-Heroes who are mobile battery installers and we have also successfully recycled almost 15 tonnes of used batteries in the span of 8 years. Mr. Azarol Faizi found that the economy was slowly transitioning to more on-demand services like Uber, MyTaxi (Grab), Food Panda and others in 2012. He observed that more and more people were using their smart phones to do a search on products and request for online services which were easier and faster. At that time, he realised that there were advantages to the on-demand battery business model. This is because prior to this, batteries were mostly sold in workshops or specific battery shops. This transitional model has helped consumers save money and time, as well as overcome other inconveniences of getting batteries themselves Bateriku.com offers free training and has created job opportunities especially for the B40 community via the B-Hero programme. Participants from this programme managed to earn at least 5 times more than their peers in similar service delivery companies. Some of the challenge they need to overcome is the issue of lead acid batteries. Their irresponsible disposal may negatively affect health and also the environment. On the bright side, almost all lead acid batteries can be recycled, which is why Bateriku.com has kick started a programme called “Go Recond, Save the World” to recycle these batteries. In this programme, batteries will undergo a thorough selection process for reinstallation and restoration purposes, and a discount will be given to used-car dealers, workshop owners and others who may find them useful for their businesses. This is how they contribute to the preservation of the environment as well."

The first project was based in Tasik Chini, Pahang YKPM together with the Indigenous Peoples Assistance Facility (IPAF) created this organic farming project, which has grown from the initial eight farmers to 40 today. YKPM Managing Director Kon Onn Sein said OA Organik had the opportunity to penetrate the local market on a premium scale because Jaya Grocer assisted farmers under the OA Organik project by transporting their produce from Kuantan to Kuala Lumpur using the supermarket chain's chiller trucks. Every month, Jaya Grocer transports three tonnes of produce from the farm. Additionally, the OA community and farmers are not expected to pay high down payments to promote or market their produce. In addition, Jaya Grocer pays them reasonable prices for their produce. Therefore, the farmers not only get to reduce their production and promotion costs, but they also get to enjoy a higher profit margin. Jaya Grocer also benefits from its partnership with OA Organik, as the brand is able to create a positive image among the rakyat through this corporate social responsibility (CSR) project.

RiceFERT is a computerised software and decision support system, that is a site-specific fertiliser management for rice production in Malaysia. It provides location-specific fertiliser recommendations according to a soil test-target yield approach. The recommendation on fertiliser rates is based on four essential components: indigenous soil nutrient status, soil fertility status, crop nutrient requirements, and target rice yield. The variety of rice used will also affect the recommendation. There is a critical need to recalibrate from using the current blanket rate of fertiliser, which has been in use for more than two decades in rice cultivation, towards a precision fertilizer management system. This is important to ensure that rice crops and soil receive the exact amount of nutrients to achieve optimal health and productivity. This technology recommends more efficient amounts of fertiliser, typically 10% to 15% less than the current blanket rate used in rice granaries. Further research is being conducted in larger scale rice granaries so that this technology can be adapted to the government fertiliser subsidy scheme."

In the rice production sector, the seed application system is used to provide data which has been collected through sensors and satellites on land levels (like the surface of land) where seeds are planted. This is helpful as there are differences in land levels which can affect the quality and quantity of rice produced. By using a farming software to identify the conditions and land levels of each land area, farmers can identify and calculate the optimum amount of seeds needed to be planted on an uneven ground to produce just as many germinated seeds as on even land areas. This enables optimum planting of paddy plant. Another important step for an optimum harvest is the nurturing process, which is related to how paddy plants are fertilised. Data about soil fertility from the fertiliser application system can help farmers and other users make more informed decisions on the amount of fertiliser required at a given area. The application of variable rate technologies can save labour costs up to 50% and reduce the use of chemical fertilisers by 25%, limiting its impact on the environment."

My Filtro Aqua Natsponge is a filter that is used to filter wastewater, which can be used at home and even in restaurants. The innovation came about as the innovator Noor Liza often came across issues of waste being clogged up in pipe holes which consequently resulted in water and air pollution. The solution is inspired from Malay traditional knowledge, whereby in villages the Malays would soak their cutleries in a basin filled with water and banana leaves. This is done because the banana leaves can absorb grease and oil from the cutleries, which would then make it easier for the cleaning process to take place. Similarly, the innovation uses banana fibers from its stem to create a sponge that would be part of the first layer in the wastewater filtration system. With improvements being made to the design and function of the wastewater filter along the way, Catappa leaves are added to the mix. The upgraded version not only filters clean and clear water as a by product, it also prevents clogs and bacteria build-up after wastewater has been filtered. What also gives the My Filtro Aqua Natsponge an edge over others is that it is relatively cheaper and it does not use synthetic sponges that are harmful to the environment. On top of that, the filter can even be connected through a smartphone app to give an indication of the pH level of the filtered water.

Specific goals: Learn about the different life cycles of the Tala (flowering, fructification, etc.) to plan when to collect seeds needed for the restoration projects. Determine the optimal planting date of Tala by conducting a collaborative experiment throughout its distribution in Argentina to locally adjust restoration strategies. Create collaborative tools for the restoration of native forests in different ecoregions through the replication of these activities with other species. Define the weak points of invasive exotic species in order to control them. 
Description of citizen participation: In the first part of the project, to learn about the different stages of the Tala's life cycle, the participants follow the same tree through its different stages of development, and report their results through a web app. In the second part, in order to determine the optimal planting date for the Tala, citizens simultaneously carry out a collaborative germination experiment in their homes or nurseries. In this context, monthly meetings are held in which preliminary results are informed and discussed and, in turn, participants help with the creation of future protocols. In future editions, in which stages 1 and 2 will be repeated, the aim is to let participants decide which species they want to continue working with according to the country's ecoregion.

When you book a holiday with TravelOnline you are making a difference to a local Fijian community. For every Fiji holiday package booked with this OTA, one is directly supporting social housing, education and welfare for Fijian families in need.
TravelOnline first partnered with Koroipita Project back in 2019, contributing FJ$12,000 towards building a new home for a Fiji family in need. As seen above, four members of their team traveled to Koroipita in rural Fiji to get involved by helping to build a new home for a Fijian family.
What is the ""Holiday with Heart"" concept?
TravelOnline was about to begin production when Covid hit and had to pause all operations since. Recently, the project has opened up again. TravelOnline customers arriving in Fiji will each receive an Eco Beach bag upon arrival. Bags are handmade with love with a special boutique operated by a group of women living in Koroipita - part of a social enterprise program.
What makes these eco bags unique?
All bags have the same turtle design made from recycled fabric offcuts! Sizes are made to fit beach towels and other holiday essentials. On top of that, inside each bag is a story card explaining the charity with a QR code - customers can choose to donate directly if they wish.

Overall goal: Monitor the loss of bee colonies in Argentina. Specific goal: Measure the mortality rate of honey and stingless bee colonies in Argentina and understand the causes behind it to help to reverse the situation or alleviate this problem. 
Description of citizen participation: A national survey only of beekeepers and meliponiculturists is conducted in person or online (website, email, social media, press media, and beekeeping magazines) to record bee colony losses. This survey is based on internationally standardized methods involving voluntary participation, a national network of beekeepers, a questionnaire, and diverse promotion strategies. Estimates and statistical analyses of colony losses depend on the participation of producers, without which it is not possible to study the mortality causes, nor to provide recommendations for reducing mortality that can inform decision-making for the sector. Each participant has to answer 35 questions about three topics: (i) Bee handling (number of beehives, type of honey harvesting, bee genetics, etc.) (ii) Presence of bio-aggressors (disease symptoms and identification, etc.) (iii) Colony loss rate (winter and summer colony losses).

Nowadays, the cultivation of berry gardens (blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, strawberries) is very popular in Georgia. Berries are mostly harvested in the hot season, and due to high temperatures, they quickly develop and begin to rot if cooling measures are not taken very quickly. In Georgia, the cold chain is not developed in such a way that the picked berries can be delivered to the quick cooling refrigerator in the desired time. By introducing the refrigerator cars developed using our concept for the berry gardens, our project offers a solution to this issue. In our hybrid concept, the required energy for cooling is obtained from solar panels mounted on the vehicle. The system also has accumulators that can be charged from the network. Using our system, farmers will solve the following problems: - The harvested berry immediately enters the cold room, and no time is wasted - We can bring the product directly to the markets by car, and it no longer needs to be transferred to another transport; - The lack of electricity in the garden is not a challenge anymore, the cooling system works on solar energy; - Service costs are getting cheaper - During the night, it is possible to have it connected to the normal electricity grid and use it as a refrigerator-storage.

The purpose of the project is to reduce the heat flow from the walls of the buildings and ensure energy efficiency. Furthermore, using our bricks reduces transportation costs (The proposed bricks are lightweight) and simplifies wall construction. For the production of our bricks we use waste obtained from secondary raw materials of plastic. Thermal conductivity of our brick is 5-7 times lower when compared to conventional one. Our bricks have a potential to completely replace conventional bricks used today, which will significantly reduce the amount of energy required to heat and cool residential, commercial and industrial buildings. Furthermore, plastic waste will be removed from the environment, and a market for a locally produced and highly efficient energy-efficient building material will be established.

Wind generator. 3 mirrors reflecting sunlight and 4 concentrators receiving reflected rays. All these components are known and widely used, but our innovation lies in the following: Mostly sunny days are windless and the wind generator itself experiences zero load. A solar reflector of a simple circuit and a high-temperature concentrator are connected to the wind generator. Hot gas flow coming from concentrator hits the blades the wind generator. In this case solar energy is used to power the wind generator and thus an additional generator at no additional cost.

The purpose of the invention is to make geothermal energy generation available anywhere on Earth and to increase the efficiency of existing technologies. Existing technologies have two main limiting factors: the insufficiently high temperature of the geothermal source on the ground surface and the small volume of the hydrothermal flow. The number of sources of satisfactory indicators is limited and mainly localized in the places where tectonic plates join. That's why, despite its obvious advantages over all other types of energy generation, geothermal energy generation can't take its share of the total energy generation. We decided to transfer the heat exchange process from the ground surface to the depth of the well (to use the natural temperature gradient) and to install the so-called ""Impulse Accelerator"". As a result, we would have constant access to a limitless supply of geothermal energy anywhere the earth's crust could be drilled or an existing well used. In the long run, nonrenewable energies will be replaced, and greenhouse gas emissions will be significantly reduced. The presented geothermal energy device contains upward (3) and downward (4) pipes fit as a continuous (joined) circuit from the ground surface (2) into the borehole (1). On the downward pipe (4), on the ground surface (2), the pump (5) is installed. The upward (3) and downward (4) pipes in the depth of the borehole (1) are connected to the heat exchanger (6). Whole surface of pipes to the heat exchanger covered by heat-insulating material. The end of the upward (3) pipe on the ground surface (2) is directed to the condensation type steam turbine (7), which is connected to the electric generator (8).

""Lille"" (the sun deity in Svan mythology) is a dynamic, intelligent system in the form of a moving platform that automatically ensures that the solar panels are always oriented precisely toward the sun. As a result, the energy performance of the attached solar panel is increased by 25% because it is automatically directed to the highest intensity of sunlight during the day.
At this point, ""Lille"" is a small-scale working prototype that was created for the purpose of demonstrating the idea at the competition and can also be referred to as a demo-robot. However, if funded, it can be replicated in practice for arbitrarily large solar panels. The only difference will be in the construction and mechanism dimensions, while the basic principles, schematic and technical approaches, sensors, and control program developed within the project are universal.

The invention's goal is to create and commercialize a solar-powered beeswax heater and hot water receiver in one combined device. Beeswax can be melted with water, steam, or in a heating chamber, which are all expensive and environmentally harmful technologies that produce low-quality wax. 
Solar melted wax is of high quality, partially sterile due to exposure to ultraviolet and infrared rays of the sun. Solar energy allows for year-round access to hot water, regardless of the ambient temperature on sunny days.
Our solar-powered device operates in hot water mode all year long - on sunny days - whereas wax melting is primarily seasonal - spring, summer, and autumn. The load of the device for wax melting is determined by the size of the beehive. The process of melting the wax and heating the water does not interfere with each other, but when the melting of the wax is finished, the efficiency of the water heater increases. Therefore, hot water can be used for different purposes.
The presented equipment saves 350-400 GEL annually for a beehive consisting of 100 bee families, taking into account all components.
There are at least 14,074 beekeepers in Georgia, and at least 5,000 of them will use the above. The received economic benefit is impressive and amounts to 1,750,000 GEL.

The invention's efficiency is defined by one axiom: it literally does not use any energy to melt the wax and produce hot water.

Ugandan Local Apprentice/Artisan innovators, led by now the Late Engineer Nsamba Christopher (may he rest in eternal peace), who was the founder and director of the African Space Research Program, developed the largest and technologically advanced baby incubator in the world, they claim. Before his demise in July 2022 to diabetes, Christopher and his colleagues had completed working on the second baby incubator and both machines were deployed in Hospitals in Kawempe and Mukono. 

This incubator has saved thousands of babies. The innovators were inspired by the worrying infant mortality rate in Uganda which was standing at 44.745 deaths per 1000 live births in 2019. Currently the rate has dropped to 40.564 deaths per 1000 live births in 2022. Perhaps these 2 machines have contributed to the reduction of the infant mortality rate.

This AI supported incubator understands and can make decisions in case of an emergency when medical personnel are not close by.

It carries 10 babies at once, in 10 different chambers.
Some babies get brain injuries (Twitches) during birth, and they end up with continuously moving body parts, when it is not the baby doing it, for example, the baby can have the hand move back and forth continuously; this can cause the baby to become so tired and die (Twitches) This machine has a technology which fixes damaged brain cells for neonates.
Some babies delay to breath upon delivery and get dead brain cells, if they survive, they become mentally disabled. This machine has a technology which stops brain cells from dying off if the baby is loaded as quickly as possible.

Normally, oxygen is delivered to babies through tubes which they bypass over the nose, this machine can deliver oxygen wirelessly to the baby, without any tubes attached to the nose. Nsamba discovered some babies are really irritated by this conventional way of oxygen delivery, so SAVANT X delivers oxygen wirelessly.

The machine is loaded with a server customized through custom-made software to be able to read the 1087 sensors deployed on board, to understand, interpret them and call out decisions accordingly, incase this machine is confused about a decision to take, it will be able to communicate to the international paediatric network, for further advice in case no local medical personnel can save a baby, and when it is trying to do so by itself."

This solution applies to cities around the world who use air conditioners to cope with heat and which demand high electricity consumption, dependent on fossil fuels and thus increase emissions. The study found that moving air with electric fans in combination to air conditioning could serve as a sustainable alternative, reducing air conditioner use and associated greenhouse gas emissions without sacrificing thermal comfort. A simple existing technology that is accessible to millions of people every day can be combined with air conditioning to potentially provide a sustainable low-tech cooling solution. Results show that the use of fans in combination with air conditioners provides a way of maintaining thermal comfort while reducing greenhouse gas emissions: 76% reduction in energy use (from 5592 GWh to 1344 GWh) and associated greenhouse gas emissions (from 5091 kilotonnes to 1208 kilotonnes).This practice can be extended with a campaign

The vast majority of the citizens of Skopje live in areas that do not meet the minimum air quality standards, mainly caused by heavy vehicle use. Skopje citizens also face disruptive public transport with lack of real time monitoring tools in most of the areas. Walking and cycling as methods of commuting have the potential to decrease vehicle use, thus can be attained by diverting motorized commuting for distance of 2 km to walking; and for distance of 5 km to bicycle commuting, by promoting healthy and active lifestyle. Namely, daily walking and cycling have various health benefits, including cardiovascular and muscular endurance, body weight control, lowered blood pressure etc. In addition, other benefits include low costs, energy efficiency, time saving during the peak period of urban traffic, and reduced noise pollution. The overall aim regarding fluctuating urban mobility is to encourage and motivate individuals (aged 18 - 65) to practice efficient mobility i.e. to walk or to use pedal or/electric bicycles, whilst altering their daily activity patterns in terms of costs, energy and environmental conservation. We influenced behavioral changes in terms of mobility by focusing on test group consisted of 50 citizens, which perceptions and behaviors were be measured before, during and after the challenges. How we did it? - Our innovative approach for citizens’ mobilization was with one of the highly rated sport/activity application-STRAVA App. The application is used to measure people’s sports activities - hiking, running, walking, cycling, swimming etc. It uses GPS, thus gives precise calculations on the speed and distance, and additionally, it calculates statistical data over periods of time (daily, weekly, monthly). If connected with smart watch, the app goes deeper in the statistics and calculates the stress level, heartbeat, pulse ox and more. It offers users to join group challenges but it also allows creation of custom made challenges - the option that we used. We created 2 group challenges – one for walking (up to 2 km daily), other for cycling (up to 6 km daily) and randomized the test group members into them. All group participants could see who reached the challenge goal and beyond, thus there was strong competitiveness among them. After the challenges ended, we calculated and checked whether all participants reached the goals. The ones that did not were disqualified, while the others were rewarded with sport equipment. The ones that went beyond the challenge got an extra reward. The pre and post research showed that people change daily habits with small incentives. 92% of the test group walking - finished the challenge, from which 65% will continue walking that distance on daily basis. 84% of the test group cycling finished the challenge, from which 61% will continue this practice on daily basis. People get extra motivation if a target is set and got competitive when are part of a bigger group. In addition, they were motivated by their engagement in the policy making process. This action also encapsulated participatory approach by providing comments and suggestions on improving the quality of urban mobility infrastructure and sending them to the relevant authorities.

Modelo artivista y financiero para la protección de las tortugas marinas
Descripción
Mizata Green es una iniciativa voluntaria que rescata huevos de tortugas marinas, que de otra forma, serían vendidos para consumo humano.
En temporada alta, los habitantes de la comunidad se dirigen en la noche a la playa para extraer miles de huevos de tortugas marinas con el interés de venderlos a los restaurantes de la zona a un buen precio. La finalidad principal de esta actividad, que resulta nociva para el medio ambiente, es la obtención de ingresos económicos. Frente a esta situación, Geovany Menjívar, fundador de Mizata Green se ha dedicado desde hace 15 años a la protección de los huevos de tortugas marina a través de la compra, y resguardo de los mismos dentro de su propiedad.
La compra de huevos para evitar que estos se conviertan en alimento humano se realiza a través de diversos medios, pero principalmente nace del dinero propio del fundador. En algunas ocasiones se recibe ayuda de las personas que llegan a observar la liberación de las tortugas en la playa, y otras veces se ha logrado la venta de piezas de arte manuales creadas por su fundador. Este último elemento resulta interesante porque el arte también ha sido considerado por el fundador como un medio para comprar huevos de tortugas marinas.
Estas piezas han sido creadas a base de materiales reciclables que han sido encontrados en la playa. El fundador de Mizata Green encuentra los materiales en la playa, los lleva a su casa, y utiliza sus herramientas para crear. El arte muchas veces ha sido comprado por extranjeros y nacionales que llegan a su casa para observar la liberación de tortuga, y el dinero recolectado se utiliza para comprar los huevos de tortuga para así seguir protegiéndolas.

Tipo de solución
Modelo sostenible de soberanía alimentaria - prototipo de invernadero.
Descripción
Esta iniciativa ha sido liderada por ADES Santa Marta, con el apoyo de la Comunidad de Madrid, que estaba interesada en traer a Centroamérica este tipo de tecnología para ver cómo se podía adaptar al país. Con esto se buscaba solventar una de las mayores problemáticas que poseía El Salvador que era la falta de soberanía alimentaria.
INVER Santa Marta fue, en sus inicios, un invernadero traído en un barco desde España. Que implicó posteriormente, un entrenamiento para que la organización pudiera hacer buen uso de este. El invernadero poseía un sensor para el monitoreo de clima, viento y todo lo que implica una tecnología para generar un ambiente controlado. Todo esto podía ser controlado desde una computadora.
El primer problema que presentó el proyecto es que debido a la complejidad que implicaba saber controlar toda la maquinaria de punta traída desde otro país, los agricultores salvadoreños, que utilizaban técnicas más artesanales no entendían sobre cómo hacer uso de estas tecnologías nuevas que necesitaban de conocimiento sobre manejo de software y programación. Otra de las problemáticas era que, el mantenimiento del invernadero significaba un costo muy alto, debido a que, si se dañaba, por ejemplo, una tarjeta electrónica del controlador del invernadero, era necesario solicitarlo y pedirlo desde España, y esperar que alguien viniera a instalar la pieza que se había descompuesto.
En aquel momento, los miembros de ADES comprendieron que introducir el invernadero con todas sus características intactas en la zona era imposible porque había que saber tener conocimientos no sólo meteorológicos, sino que también tecnológicos, químicos, etc. El proyecto irá quedando abandonado, paulatinamente. Hasta que 10 jóvenes de Santa Marta, que se encontraban en bachillerato, decidieron retomarlo pero adaptándolo a las características propias del territorio. Ya que esto evitaría que el invernadero fuera dependiente de las tecnologías que había que importar de países desarrollados a costos altos. De esta manera, lo que se hizo fue volver toda la tecnología del invernadero adaptable para la comunidad, buscando métodos más artesanales para que el invernadero siguiera funcionando y cambiando la estructura de forma que si una pieza se descomponía podía ser comprada en El Salvador. Fue así como se simplificó la tecnología para la comunidad. Además, para adquirir los conocimientos necesarios para el cultivo de hortalizas dentro del invernadero, miembros de ADES tuvieron la oportunidad de acudir a cursos especializados sobre agricultura y soberanía alimentaria, además recibieron información de parte de otras organizaciones latinoamericanas que estaban trabajando en estas temáticas. Se comenzó a investigar cómo se podía hacer una tecnología apropiada que permitiera saber cómo crear un monitoreo climático y cómo comenzar a controlar el clima dentro del invernadero.
Gracias a lo anterior, se inició la construcción placas y sensores de monitoreo propios, cómo automáticamente activar el riego cuando la planta necesita el agua en la raíz o cuando la necesita la altura, medir el calor en el aire, entre otras cosas. Por otro lado, también se ha trabajado en informar a la comunidad sobre estos procesos, se ha entrenado a niños, jóvenes, adultos para impartir conocimiento.
Se han realizado pequeños laboratorios con gente joven para que esta pueda empezar a programar en las actividades que el invernadero lo requiera.
La transferencia de saberes prácticos como elemento diferenciador del proyecto
Se han realizado una diversidad de capacitaciones para que la comunidad pueda controlar el invernadero. Se han ejecutado talleres con profesionales para los jóvenes de la comunidad; se les explica cada componente que forma parte del invernadero, se les instruye para que pueda automatizar censores, entre otras cosas.
Este año se ha trabajado en brindar talleres con la finalidad de enseñarle a los agricultores acerca de cómo utilizar tecnologías básicas para los cultivos en los invernaderos. Con esto se busca tener una producción local apropiada, teniendo como base materiales que sí se pueden conseguir en El Salvador para que puedan ser reemplazados en caso de que se arruinen, también se busca capacitar a la gente para distribuir, replicar, y entender el conocimiento necesario para que el INVER siga funcionando.
Lo que se produce en el invernadero, va para el consumo comunitario. Se comercializan los vegetales en los mercados de la comunidad, y con eso basta para que estos se acaben.
El INVER Santa Marta ha firmado convenios con diferentes actores estratégicos para lograr la buena distribución de los productos que nacen en el invernadero. Sin embargo, no debe dejarse de lado que la finalidad primordial del invernadero es que los vegetales sean comercializados y consumidos dentro de la comunidad.

Descripción
Latas, botellas, zapatos, juguetes, y otros desechos sólidos y plásticos pueden ser encontrados en uno de los diez ríos que desembocan en el Lago de Ilopango pero son retenidos gracias a la eco-borda que elaboro la Asociación Pro Lago de Ilopango en el 2021 y que, desde entonces, ha permitido evitar que más de 6 toneladas de basura ingresen a las aguas.
En los últimos cinco años la contaminación de las aguas ha aumentado en un 30%, según miembros de la organización Pro Lago de Ilopango. Frente a esta problemática los habitantes de las comunidades cercanas al lago decidieron replicar la construcción de una eco-borda similar a las que se encuentran en el Lago de Coatepeque pero adaptándola a sus características particulares. Inicialmente la eco-borda, que fue construida con botellas plásticas, medía 120 metros pero debido a la gran cantidad de contaminantes provenientes del río Chaguite se vieron en la necesidad de ampliar 60 metros más. Hoy en día la eco-borda de 180 metros situada en el Lago de Ilopango contiene 4,368 botellas plásticas de 2.5 y 3 litros, con estas medidas se logran que 4.35 toneladas de desechos sólidos no ingresen al lago.
¿Cuál es el proceso para la recolección de los desechos sólidos que desembocan del Río Chaguite?
Miembros de la Asociación de Ilopango se dirigen al lugar donde se encuentra localizada la eco-borda despúes de una tormenta, se recolectan todos los desechos que vienen en las aguas del rió y quedan retenidos en la borda, y se comienza a clasificar la basura recolectada. Los materiales que pueden ser reciclados los recibe el Parque Industrial, y lo demás es entregado a la Alcaldía Municipal de Santiago Texacuangos.

Descripción
Plasti.Co consiste en generar una vinculación de actores para el reciclaje de plástico, con esto se busca poder agregarle valor a un material mal desechado, usualmente como el plástico, por medio de cómo el diseño puede generar una oportunidad de reutilizar este plástico que lo vemos día a día en nuestras calles y crear productos de alto valor que permitan generar un impacto positivo en el ambiente y en las comunidades.
Con Plasti.Co se busca cerrar una cadena de valor, siendo un componente de procesado de plástico reciclado, y buscar alianzas con otras instituciones que recopilan o consolidan información y que pueden distribuir ciertos materiales o productos para que, por medio del diseño, se les pueda agregar valor a un material que ha sido invisibilizado hasta el momento.
¿En qué se inspira el proyecto?
El proyecto Plasti.Co se inspira en el proyecto de código abierto, Precious Plastic. Se retoma la esencia del proyecto mundial y se tropicaliza al contexto de El Salvador.
Esta iniciativa de carácter global de Precious Plastic nace en 2016. Y básicamente presentan cuatro tipos de máquina para el reciclado de plástico: una trituradora, una expulsora, una inyectora y un horno compresor. La idea que tiene esta iniciativa, y que todavía ha venido evolucionando, es que en lugar de buscar un solo centro gigantesco para poder suplir esta demanda de reprocesar el plástico en nuevos productos, se busca más bien distribuir la información y la tecnología para generar diferentes centros a menor escala para que entre todos se pueda afrontar el reto de procesar la gran cantidad de plástico mal desechado. Es así como se empieza a generar una comunidad nivel global en donde se van generando diferentes tipos de involucramiento de las personas que van desde sólo el apoyo comunitario, centros de recolección, o talleres de máquinas. Hay una diversidad de modelos de negocio que ya existen y que también están en la web que permiten poder ser retomados para aplicarlos en la región.
La intención con Plasti.Co es cómo poder generar en El Salvador un punto más en el que se pueda revalorizar el material que no ha sido reprocesado democráticamente, por así decirlo.
Entonces se empieza a diseñar estas máquinas, basadas en las que ya existían, y como estudio de diseño industrial, en LERO Studios se veía fundamental darle un estilo propio. Es ahí donde el diseño ha servido para poder adaptar esta información a contextos y posibilidades propias de El Salvador. Entonces el diseño también ve las oportunidades de procesar el plástico en productos con una historia con mayor valor y que pueden funcionar para resolver problemas de nuestras comunidades.
¿Qué tipo de productos se pueden generar a partir de este proyecto?
Al vincular a Plasti.Co con las comunidades vulnerables de El Salvador, se pueden dar oportunidades de producción y de creación que permiten que este proyecto sea capaz de identificar las necesidades que existen en las personas.
Plasti.Co nos permite entonces generar mobiliario para mejorar las condiciones de las viviendas en estas comunidades. Nos permite generar una diversidad de opciones para mejorar el contexto de las comunidades, a la misma vez que se aprende cómo las personas interactúan, no solo entre ellas, sino también con sus desechos.
La versatilidad de las máquinas permite la construcción de mesas, bancos, sillas, bancas, repisas, closets, piezas pequeñas como colgadores, escritorios, entre otros. Un ejemplo de lo anterior sería una iniciativa que consistió en la produción de medallas para la carrera del ECOFEST. La idea era prototipar esta especie de modelo de la medalla hecha de plástico; poder generar un lienzo en blanco que se pudiera personalizar según la carrera o según el evento. De ahí se cuentan con otros prototipos que son como azulejos, la intención era poder explorar temas de acabados de material.
¿Consideras que la clave para la sostenibilidad de proyecto es el diseño o la masificación?
Es una mezcla de ambos, la masificación permite la producción, pero es necesario el diseño para la deseabilidad de estos productos y para que estos sean más competitivos, comercialmente hablando. Se ha visto que una pieza diseñada con cierta estética contemporánea permite vender el producto dos o tres veces más que un producto artesanalmente hecho. Entonces el diseño sí es el valor diferenciador porque hace que el producto se vuelva deseable.
La ventaja es que el diseño le agrega valor a las piezas, y al tener más ingreso se permite la sostenibilidad del proyecto.
¿Cuál es la diferencia de plasti.Co respecto a otras iniciativas de economía circular?
La maquinaria que ha sido adaptada permite hacer experimentos que van a dar información, conocimiento y oportunidades de crear productos, que por medio del diseño, tendrán un valor agregado.
La diferencia respecto a otros proyectos de reciclado de plástico es la versatilidad que permite que se trabaje con un material tan preciado como el plástico. Esta versatilidad abre la posibilidad de hacer pruebas mezclando diferentes materiales y permite probar materiales que usualmente no son reciclados en la industria, conectando puntos donde el plástico abunda y que nadie lo quiere.
Por otro lado, también es importante destacar que el diseño de las máquinas permite que estas sean utilizadas por cualquier persona; es decir que son perfectamente manipulables.

The Color Movement is a co-creation between Catholic Sisters, Alight (formerly American Refugee Committee), and Sisters Rising Worldwide. The main objective is to amplify and sustain the work of the Sisters as they spark change and save lives in some of the toughest communities out there.
Catholic Sisters are the guiding stars as they bring support to the communities that need to thrive, and share their stories.
How it all began
The work with Sisters Rising Worldwide first took root in El Salvador and then along the U.S.-Mexico border. TCM found that the Sisters were some of the most impactful, inspiring, and beloved members of the community, making change day in and day out. The Sisters in El Salvador offer an alternative identity to a life of violence, one that thrives on goodness, peace and unity. And the Sisters on the border act as first-responders and frontline humanitarians, helping families survive some of the darkest times of their lives.
Through increased support and collaboration from the Color Movement, they're putting more resources into the Sisters’ hands, strengthening their work in El Salvador and at the border. But that’s just the beginning. The movement is going global, responding to the coronavirus around the globe, and getting behind Sisters who are helping to keep their communities safe.
How it works
A colorful, joyful identity is sometimes what communities need to rally under. This can look like Color Movement murals at youth centers, where before there was a blank and peeling wall. It can look like our buttons and t-shirts for people on the move, uniting them in peace, or it can look like original Color Movement art pieces created by young people and proudly hung on their bedroom walls.
They channel support both big and small, and tailored to their specific communities – things like new youth centers, school supplies, vocational training, computers, recreational equipment for migrant shelters, painting classes, women’s empowerment programs, gloves, masks, and soap for coronavirus prevention, and more.
As they share stories of this women-powered movement, they're also helping people see and find the Sisters, and help the Sisters find each other. In El Salvador, this looks like bringing in local advocates and partners like Global Shapers San Salvador, adding a spark of creativity, talent, and connections that bridge the gap between Sisters and the wider community. Or it can look like Zoom calls with Sisters from all over the world, swapping ideas and building solidarity during a time of isolation. Or connecting Sisters to medical advisors and COVID-19 experts for virtual training as they navigate the uncertain waters of the pandemic.
The Color Movement in La Chacra community
The space created in the community of La Chacra, in Soyapango, was born out of the desire to have a space for young people. For its construction, we began to investigate a human-centered design with the young people who were in the different programs implemented by the volunteers of The Color Movement. This activity allowed a greater understanding of what were the struggles of these young people in their contexts.
From this, it was understood that the young people lacked a space to develop and carry out leisure activities; they had their homes but there were also their families, they went to school with their peers but there were also other dynamics because they were in an academic space. And apart from those two places, they had no other available space but the street. So it was decided to create a space that became a tool for the development of young people, who were looking for recognition, involvement, and to be heard. This is how this space was designed in La Chacra, as an opportunity for them to make decisions.
The color palette responds to the Color Movement, and it is through these tones that we seek to fill the communities with color. However, the real estate design responds to a modularity that can be generated from common materials in the area. So within this space there are square tubes, corrugated sheets, and other materials that are easily available in the country. In addition, modules were designed so that they could be assembled within the space with the community, which allowed us to teach the young people involved to use tools, to have a perception of how to take care of the furniture, and work tools. It was hoped that the young people would believe that if they can change four walls, it is very likely that they can change their entire community.
The most important thing to highlight with the design and creation of the space was the word ''belonging'', which was something that the young people longed for and that was missing within the community. This sense of belonging was created through the creation of the space which is a place where young people can carry out their activities, it is a space where they feel safe and that helps them to focus on what they really want for their future.
LERO Studios
LERO is a crucial partner for The Color Movement Projects. They have been able to identify the community's needs and transform those gaps into customized, community-responsive projects. Under this vision, LERO works closely with the Sisters and the youth to support the human-centered design (HCD) process throughout every project. Roberto and Leo are sharing their knowledge ideas continuously.

En el mundo, el Cambio Climático está teniendo consecuencias devastadoras. Centroamérica ha sido históricamente vulnerable a desastres naturales (terremotos, huracanes, deslaves de tierra e inundaciones) y vive en amenaza ambiental a causa de modelos económicos extractivistas y depredadores de los recursos naturales. Creemos que la cultura y la transformación digital, pueden ayudar a transformar la economía y sociedad salvadoreña, creando nuevas herramientas y medidas de adaptación y mitigación frente a los efectos del cambio climático.
Cartografías Líquidas tiene tres componentes: Tunantal, mapa de iniciativas medioambientales liderado por el Vivero de Iniciativas Ciudadanas (España), una residencia artística y de creación cuyo objetivo principal es fortalecer y visibilizar a organizaciones medioambientalistas salvadoreñas y generar una mayor concienciación sobre el cambio climático a través de prácticas artísticas y una exposición, resultado de este trabajo de producción artística.
En la exposición participaron los artistas que realizaron residencias artísticas durante el mes de agosto de 2022 en diferentes puntos el país: Emilie Beffara (Francia) y Jennifer Gisela Cerritos (El Salvador) desarrollaron sus proyectos en la sede de ADES Santa Marta, en los municipios de Victoria y Guacotecti (Cabañas); Jorge Ávalos (El Salvador) y Víctor Artiga (El Salvador) trabajaron en Comasagua (La Libertad), junto a la Cooperativa La Canasta Campesina; Napoleón Alfaro (El Salvador) y María Luisa Martínez (España) realizaron su residencia en Suchitoto (Cuscatlán), con Plataforma Global.
La exposición Cartografías Líquidas es una muestra colectiva multidisciplinar que incluye arte sonoro, documentales, fotografías, escultura y performance o acción artística

En mayo de 2017, un grupo de organizaciones sociales impulsaron la primer ''Consulta Popular por el Derecho Humano al Agua'', esta se realizó en mayo de 2017, sin embargo, no se alcanzó la cantidad de votos necesario con el SÍ para que esta consulta fuera vinculante. Después, en 2019, con un movimiento social fortalecido e integrado por más organizaciones que estaban luchando por el Derecho Humano al Agua se prepararó la segunda ''Consulta Popular por el Derecho Humano al Agua''. Este nuevo proceso implicó una serie de acciones de información, sensibilización, organización, capacitación y comunicación para lograr un cambio social en el municipio.
Dos Consultas Populares por el Derecho Humano al Agua en Suchitoto marcaron una de las más importantes luchas que ha encabezado la sociedad civil organizada en el municipio. A casi dos años de la última Consulta Popular donde la ciudadanía dijo SÍ a declarar el agua como un derecho humano, el martes 21 de septiembre de 2021finalmente se pudo pasar de una declaratoria a una ordenanza que se encargará de regular actividades que pongan el riesgo el acceso al agua potable de calidad en Suchitoto.
Esta es una Solución Medioambiental de Base que ha sido identificada por el Laboratorio de Aceleración del Programa de las Naciones Unidas en El Salvador, con el apoyo de Plataforma Global, en el marco de la Gira de Mapeo de Soluciones Ambientales.
Tipo de solución
Ordenanza municipal.
Descripción
El proceso para que se firmara esta ordenanza municipal que sienta un precedente en Suchitoto para el acceso al vital líquido estuvo liderado por el Movimiento de Organizaciones Unidxs por el Agua en Suchitoto. Inicialmente debía ser la administración municipal la encargada de elaborar la Ordenanza pero frente a la falta interés del gobierno local por solventar la problemática, fue la Sociedad Civil la que decidió organizarse y ejercer su ciudadaní activa. Unidxs por el Agua asumió la creación de este documento que fue elaborado de manera participativa e integral, con insumos brindados por la población.
El 25 de mayo de 2021, la propuesta elaborada fue presentada ante el Concejo Municipal, obteniendo como resultado la creación de una comisión jurídica entre representantes de la Alcaldía Municipal de Suchitoto y Unidxs por el Agua. En un período de 90 días se encargarían de revisar, hacer sugerencias, modificaciones y subsanar vacíos que pudiera contener este instrumento. El proceso de revisión de los 31 artículos, que contenía en un principio la Ordenanza, tardó un poco más de los 90 días acordados. Según representantes de la municipalidad, la evaluación debía tardar lo necesario porque tenían que asegurarse que los artículos estuvieran basados en los marcos legales correspondientes.
Una vez revisados minuciosamente cada uno de los artículos, se presentó en el Concejo Municipal el ante proyecto de Ordenanza Municipal para la Protección y Conservación del Recurso Hídrico del Municipio de Suchitoto Departamento de Cuscatlán. Luego de la discusión interna del anteproyecto, la Alcaldía Municipal de conformidad al artículo 162 de la Ley de Procedimientos Administrativos, sometió a consulta pública de los habitantes del municipio el anteproyecto de Ordenanza, donde se esperaba que la ciudadanía dejara sugerencias u observaciones. Finalizado el tiempo estipulado no se registró ningún comentario, y esto dio a entender que la población estuvo de acuerdo con lo que la herramienta legal contenía.
El día jueves 16 de septiembre del mismo año se tenía prevista la aprobación de la Ordenanza para la Protección del Recurso Hídrico. En presencia de representantes de Unidxs por el Agua, Durán, ante el Concejo Municipal, se sometió a votación la aprobación del instrumento, el cual fue aprobado por unanimidad; sin embargo, el acto fue únicamente simbólico porque la herramienta no estaba impresa para que pudiera ser firmada por los Regidores Municipales. De esta manea, en una nueva sesión de Concejo realizada el martes 21 de septiembre se sometió nuevamente a votación la aprobación del instrumento, ya que se habían identificado errores de ortografía y de formas en el documento. En una discusión a puerta cerrada del Concejo Municipal se dio lectura a cada uno de los artículos que contiene la Ordenanza, 30 en total, coincidiendo cada uno de ellos con el acuerdo unánime de la municipalidad y el Movimiento UxA.
La aprobación de una ordenanza municipal para el tema del agua en Suchitoto es importante, pues significa un marco normativo que defiende no solamente los temas relacionados al agua, si no también las zonas de recarga, mantos acuíferos y los ecosistemas en general, que son necesarios para un equilibrio armónico con el medio ambiente y la vida.

Contributory project: It is designed by scientists, and citizens participate in data collection.
Objective: Overall goal: -Monitor habitat quality of inland aquatic ecosystems with citizen participation. Specific goals: -Generate a mapping of the habitat state of inland aquatic ecosystems. -Recognize the environmental factors that positively and negatively impact freshwater ecosystems. -Generate new monitoring tools for these ecosystems. -Calibrate existing tools to evaluate them. 
Description of citizen participation: Citizen scientists analyze the state of the habitat in aquatic environments, through the digital app for Android devices or the project website. The data and information collected are sent and centralized in the PreserVamos online database and are then used to generate a real-time, open-access map of the state of the aquatic habitat. In addition, citizen scientists can learn about the flora and fauna described near their location, thanks to the linking of the digital app with the ArgentiNat project database (iNaturalist), and learn about the environmental public policies of the municipality to which they belong. In turn, the municipalities that wish to participate in the project can request open access for their environmental areas to manage and visualize the data sent by the citizens of their territory. They can also request the project team to add specific environmental indicators to the app that they believe are relevant for the citizens of their environments and download and use project advertising material for events in their territory.

Communal curatorial co-design system

Creation and implementation of the ""Community of curatorial practice"" from the Barbados Museum and Historical Society regarding the co-design of artistic and cultural exhibits rooted in shared meaning and identity. The practice is derived from the Lave and Wenger concept of a community of practice, which speaks to a social theory of learning based on relations among persons, activities and the world over time. The concept was adapted for the Museum by developing a curatorial community with shared interest in the development of exhibitions in a co-curated manner in order to develop a continual practice of review of exhibition material and provision of community feedback. Sustainability is also key with relationships being built through shared learning in the process.

Description: The way these systems work is through the installation of PVC collecting gutters on the edges of sheet roofs. These gutters conduct rainwater into a water tank, where the water is stored. Once the water is stored, the beneficiary families can open a tap, which allows the passage of water through a filter that purifies the liquid, for later consumption.
Interesting features: It is a replicable method in different communities, since the organization has created a manual so that anyone can do it in their homes. In addition to capturing rainwater, it can filter it directly. The materials can be purchased at any hardware store and are relatively affordable."
